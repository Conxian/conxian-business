# Repo readiness gates by control domain (CON-227)

This page defines the **minimum control gates** required for each active flagship and supporting Conxian repository (see [repo portfolio](./REPO_PORTFOLIO.md)), so we can consistently decide:

- what is safe to keep **public**,
- what can **ship** (be deployed / released) without additional controls,
- what must remain **private** (kept in Linear under ZSE), and
- what needs **additional controls** before rollout.

Canonical tracker:

## Current status

**Status:** Living document. Update when any repo is added/renamed or when gate requirements change.

This document defines the _required gates_ by repo and does **not** claim that those gates are already satisfied.

## How to use this document

1. For a repo, locate its row in the mapping section.
2. For each control domain, treat the required gate level as **release-blocking** for production rollout.
3. A repo can remain public if it meets **Public-safe baseline gates** (below) and does not contain ZSE-restricted content.

### Public-safe baseline (applies to all repos)

All repos (public or private) must satisfy:

- No secrets / keys / seed phrases / private endpoints committed (`.env.example` only).
- No ZSE-restricted content tracked (validated via repo-hygiene CI checks for ZSE knowledge retention).
- `SECURITY.md` present and accurate reporting flow.
- `CODEOWNERS` covers the repo and its high-risk paths.

## Control domains and gate levels

Gate levels are intentionally coarse. Use them to prevent “we can ship” ambiguity.

Legend:

- `0` = not applicable / no meaningful exposure (N/A for this repo; there is no `L0` / `RC0` / etc.)
- `1` = baseline controls
- `2` = elevated controls (security/compliance review required)
- `3` = critical controls (formal sign-off + multi-party operating controls)

Unless otherwise specified, gate levels are cumulative: level `N` assumes the controls of levels `0..N-1` are also in place.

> Use level `0` only when the domain has been explicitly assessed and determined to have no meaningful exposure for that repo (not as a default when unsure).

### L — Legal / public-safe status

- **L1**: License clarity (SPDX-compatible where possible), contributor guidance, and a public-safe README (no claims that contradict repo visibility).
- **L2**: Explicit user-facing disclaimers (where relevant), trademark/IP review of names/logos, and third-party dependency/license review.
- **L3**: Formal legal sign-off before production rollout and any public “regulated” positioning.

### RC — Regulatory / compliance controls

- **RC1**: Clear scope boundaries (“not legal advice”, “not a compliance guarantee”), plus audit-friendly logging where applicable.
- **RC2**: Documented compliance control surface (e.g., sanctions screening hooks, policy-driven allow/deny lists, retention/audit logs).
- **RC3**: Named compliance owner + evidence trail for changes (change-control, approvals, external review where required).

### FT — Funds / treasury impact

- **FT1**: No funds can be moved; only mocks/simulations/test fixtures.
- **FT2**: Can construct/sign transactions on testnet or in isolated/dev contexts; requires key-handling docs and “no mainnet by default”.
- **FT3**: Any codepath that can move or authorize **mainnet** value; requires multi-sig / dual-control approvals, separation of duties, and an incident runbook.

### OC — On-chain execution risk

- **OC1**: Read-only chain interactions.
- **OC2**: Can deploy/upgrade on testnets or can submit transactions to production networks behind explicit flags.
- **OC3**: Mainnet deployment/upgrade tooling or protocol contracts; requires preflight checks, staged rollout plan, and security review/audit evidence.

### DC — Decentralization / custody posture

- **DC1**: Explicitly non-custodial posture; keys remain user-controlled; recovery model documented.
- **DC2**: Key material handled on-device/in-app (wallet-grade security expectations); requires threat model + secure storage and signing boundaries.
- **DC3**: Custodial or delegated custody model; requires formal custody policy, licensing/compliance posture, and operating controls.

### DR — Deployment readiness

- **DR1**: Build/run instructions + minimal smoke path.
- **DR2**: CI checks, versioning/release tags, and environment/secrets hygiene.
- **DR3**: Production runbook: monitoring, rollback, incident response, and change-control.

### OWN — Business-operating ownership

- **OWN1**: Named maintainers (`CODEOWNERS`) and repo mission.
- **OWN2**: Operating owner (service owner / product owner), escalation path, and basic SLO expectations.
- **OWN3**: RACI defined for high-risk operations (treasury, deployments, custody) and multi-party approval requirements.

## Repo mapping (required gates)

Notes:

- “Public posture” is about **GitHub visibility**, not production readiness.
- “Ship posture” is about whether the repo can be used to **deploy / release** without extra controls.

### Supporting repos

Superproject note: `Conxian_UI` is checked out at path `conxian-ui/` (planned rename tracked in CON-238).

## Interpretation / decisions

### What can ship without additional controls

Repos with Ship posture and no `FT3`/`OC3` exposure can generally ship with standard engineering hygiene (no secrets, basic CI). Based on the mapping above, that includes:

- `conxian-labs-site`
- `lib-conxian-core`
- `conxian-business` (docs/spec changes)
- `.github` (org-wide defaults; still requires careful review due to blast radius)

### What must stay private (content-level, not necessarily repo-level)

Regardless of repo visibility, the following content **must not be tracked in GitHub** and should live in Linear under ZSE:

- treasury signing procedures, key custody details, seed phrases, private endpoints
- partner/customer confidential details
- internal M&A / strategy artifacts that create asymmetric risk

### What needs additional controls before rollout

Any repo with `FT3` and/or `OC3` is “break-glass” territory and needs formal operating controls before mainnet rollout. Based on the mapping above, that includes:

- `Conxian`
- `conxius-wallet`
- `stacksorbit`

Service surfaces with `RC2` and `DR3` require an operating owner + incident posture before production use:

- `conxian-gateway`
- `conxian-nexus`

## Follow-ups (recommended)

1. Confirm custody posture for `conxius-wallet` (target: non-custodial) and align `DC` level wording accordingly.
2. Add a lightweight “evidence” section per flagship repo (links to CI, release tags, runbooks in Linear) without embedding sensitive details.
3. Reconcile public messaging in the `conxian-business` repo description with ZSE language (avoid stating it contains non-public docs if it is public).
