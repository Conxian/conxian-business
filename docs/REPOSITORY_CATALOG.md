# Repository catalog

This catalog is the Conxian organization-level map of _what each repository is for_ and _how it should be presented publicly_.

The `conxian-business` repository is an umbrella repo that vendors key Conxian repositories as Git submodules (see `.gitmodules`).

## Categories

- **Platform**: orchestration stacks and operator-facing service surfaces (local dev, admin portals).
- **Wallet**: end-user, non-custodial wallet applications.
- **Gateway**: institutional middleware and API surfaces.
- **UI**: web frontends (distinct from the broader Platform stack).
- **Website**: marketing, docs, and landing pages.
- **Shared core**: libraries intended to be depended on by other repos.
- **Protocol**: smart contracts and protocol logic.
- **State node**: long-running nodes that maintain Conxian/BOS state and participate in protocol operations.
- **Internal (Ops/Admin)**: governance, OpenSpec, audits, and internal orchestration.
- **Tooling**: CLI tools and supporting utilities used for deployment, monitoring, or developer workflows.

## Quick map (by function)

- **Wallet**: `conxius-wallet`
- **Gateway**: `conxian-gateway`
- **Platform**: `conxius-platform`
- **UI**: `conxian-ui` (Git submodule directory `conxian-ui/`; upstream repo currently `Conxian_UI`; rename to `conxian-ui` tracked in CON-435)
- **Shared core**: `lib-conxian-core`, `lib-conclave-sdk`
- **Protocol**: `Conxian`
- **State node**: `conxian-nexus`
- **Tooling**: `stacksorbit`
- **Website**: `conxian-labs-site`
- **Internal (Ops/Admin)**: `conxian-business`

## Recommended pins (GitHub org profile)

If we can only pin a few repos on the GitHub org profile, these are the clearest entry points:

1. `conxius-wallet` (Wallet)
2. `conxian-gateway` (Gateway)
3. `Conxian_UI` (UI; vendored as `conxian-ui/`; rename to `conxian-ui` tracked in CON-435) or `conxius-platform` (Platform)
4. `Conxian` (Protocol)
5. `lib-conxian-core` (Shared core)
6. `conxian-labs-site` (Website)

## Public README expectations (per repository)

For all user-facing repos (Wallet, Gateway, Platform, UI, Website, Shared core), the README should include:

- `## Purpose`: a 2–5 line description of the repository’s job.
- `## Status`: one of `active`, `alpha`, `beta`, `stable`, `maintenance`, `archived`, plus a short “what’s safe to use”.
- `## Ownership`: pointer to CODEOWNERS/maintainers.
- `## Releases`: how versions/tags are produced and where to find release notes.

## Release discipline (minimum bar)

- Use SemVer tags: `vX.Y.Z`.
- Keep `CHANGELOG.md` in [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format with a top-level `## [Unreleased]` section.
- For user-facing behavior changes, do not merge without an entry in `CHANGELOG.md`.
