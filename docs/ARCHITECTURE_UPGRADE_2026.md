# Conxian Architecture Upgrade: Enterprise & Multi-Chain Sovereignty (2026)

This document defines the architectural blueprint for the 2026 upgrades to the Conxian ecosystem, focusing on hardware-level security, enterprise ERP integration, and expanded multi-chain support.

## 1. Unified Hardware Security Matrix

We are enforcing a strict hardware-anchored root of trust across all deployment environments to ensure "Zero Secret Egress" and trustless execution.

### 1.1 Mobile Client (Conxius)
*   **Hardware**: Android TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) and StrongBox.
*   **Role**: Non-custodial key management for retail and SME users. Biometric-enclosed signing.

### 1.2 Desktop Client (Conxius Desktop)
*   **Hardware**: TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module).

### 1.3 Enterprise Infrastructure (Gateway & Nexus)
*   **Hardware**: Dedicated HSM (Hardware Security Module) - FIPS 140-2 Level 3.

## 2. Enterprise ERP (F-ERP) Upgrade Suite

The Conxian bond issuance and treasury systems are evolving into dynamic, trust-minimized institutional primitives.

### 2.1 Dynamic Collateral Engine (DCE)
*   **Non-Liquidating Stabilization**: Uses the Dynamic Collateral Ratio (DCR) formula:
    $DCR = \frac{OnChain\_Liq + Attested\_ERP\_Revenue + Pending\_Rev}{Active\_Bonds \times Risk\_Multiplier}$
*   **Revenue Interception**: Automatically redirects enterprise revenue to top up positions when DCR falls below **110%**.
*   **Advanced Correction**: When DCR falls below **105%**, the engine natively triggers parameter adjustments (e.g., duration extensions) to avoid forced liquidations of the core treasury.

### 2.2 Intelligent Bond Structuring (IBS)
*   **Programmatic Underwriting**: Automatically determines bond principal caps (3x net cash flow) using TLSNotary-attested ERP data.

### 2.3 Productive Streaming (The Golden Rule)
*   **The Engine**: Enforces the mathematical constraint that operational outflow ($) can never exceed accumulated liquid yield ($).
*   **Constraint**:  \leq Y_h$. Any attempt to dilute locked principal ($) for OpEx results in a transaction revert.

### 2.4 SWIFT Bypass & Zero-Trust Connectivity
*   **ISO-20022 Native**: The `enterprise-api.clar` handles USD-native settlements via USDCx.
*   **Zero-Trust Reconciliation**: Nexus State Node provides hardware-attested settlement receipts.

## 3. Multi-Chain Full Stack Support (>70% TAM)

*   **Bitcoin Ecosystem**: Native BTC, sBTC (NTT), Stacks (Nakamoto/Clarity).
*   **Ethereum (EVM)**: Full NTT and EIP-712 support.
*   **Solana**: Native Solana transaction building and NTT support.
