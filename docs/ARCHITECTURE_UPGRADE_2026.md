# Conxian Architecture Upgrade: Enterprise & Multi-Chain Sovereignty (2026)

This document defines the architectural blueprint for the 2026 upgrades to the Conxian ecosystem, focusing on hardware-level security, enterprise ERP integration, and expanded multi-chain support.

## 1. Unified Hardware Security Matrix

We are enforcing a strict hardware-anchored root of trust across all deployment environments to ensure "Zero Secret Egress" and trustless execution.

### 1.1 Mobile Client (Conxius)
*   **Hardware**: Android TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) and StrongBox.
*   **Role**: Non-custodial key management for retail and SME users. Biometric-enclosed signing.

### 1.2 Desktop Client (Conxius Desktop)
*   **Hardware**: TPM 2.0 (Trusted Platform Module).
*   **Integration**: Wired via `tss-esapi` library.
*   **Security Features**:
    *   **Secure Boot Attestation**: Verify the integrity of the wallet binary before execution.
    *   **Key Sealing**: Master seed is sealed to PCRs (Platform Configuration Registers), preventing decryption if the system state is altered.
    *   **Hardware-backed Entropy**: Use TPM's TRNG for seed generation.

### 1.3 Enterprise Infrastructure (Gateway & Nexus)
*   **Hardware**: Dedicated HSM (Hardware Security Module) - FIPS 140-2 Level 3.
*   **Integration**: PKCS#11 interface via the `cryptoki` crate.
*   **Access Control**: Mandatory FIDO2/WebAuthn authentication for HSM signing requests.
*   **Server Integrity**: TPM 2.0 attestation for all enterprise node applications to prevent "Evil Maid" attacks and unauthorized software modification.

## 2. Enterprise ERP Bond Underwriting (Fusion Gateway)

The Conxian bond issuance system is evolving into a dynamic, trust-minimized credit primitive.

### 2.1 ERP Connectivity
*   **Connectors**: SOAP/WSDL for SAP (Legacy/Institutional), REST/OAuth for Oracle NetSuite and Microsoft Dynamics.
*   **Data Fetching**: Periodic polling of Revenue, OpEx, and CapEx metrics.

### 2.2 Oracle & Data Integrity
*   **TLSNotary**: Use TLSNotary to generate cryptographic proofs of data authenticity directly from the enterprise ERP's TLS session.
*   **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**: Generate ZK-proofs (via RISC0) of financial health metrics (e.g., DCR calculation) to allow for underwriting without exposing sensitive raw data on-chain.

### 2.3 On-Chain Underwriting (Clarity 4)
*   **Dynamic Collateral Ratio (DCR)**:
    1771DCR = \frac{\text{On-chain Liquidity} + \text{Verified ERP Revenue}}{\text{Bond Debt}}1771
*   **144-Block Timelock**: All ERP-verified revenue intended for bond servicing is routed through a mandatory 144-block timelocked vault (`yield-router.clar`).
*   **Auto-Correction**: The yield router automatically intercepts funds to re-collateralize the bond if the DCR drops below the 1.1 threshold.

## 3. Multi-Chain Full Stack Support (>70% TAM)

To maximize business impact, the ecosystem provides deep integration for the industry's most dominant networks.

### 3.1 Network Matrix
*   **Bitcoin Ecosystem**: Native BTC, sBTC (NTT), Stacks (Nakamoto/Clarity).
*   **Ethereum (EVM)**: Full stack support including EIP-1559, EIP-712 structured signing, and Native Token Transfer (NTT) framework integration.
*   **Solana (Non-EVM)**: Integration of the Ed25519 curve in `lib-conclave-sdk`. Native Solana transaction building and NTT support.

### 3.2 Library Integrations
*   **NTT Framework**: Wormhole Native Token Transfer (NTT) for sBTC and USDCx.
*   **Oracle**: TLSNotary + RISC0 for verifiable off-chain data.
*   **Signing**: Musig2 (Bitcoin), ECDSA (ETH), Ed25519 (Solana).

## 4. Institutional DeFi Readiness
*   **Custody Compatibility**: Full support for Fireblocks/Copper via standard signing interfaces (SIP-018, EIP-712).
*   **Regulatory Compliance**: Integrated `regulatory-adapter.clar` for institutional whitelisting and auditability.

# F-ERP Bond System Upgrade (2026)

## Overview
The F-ERP Bond Upgrade implements a Bitcoin-native credit model for SMEs and enterprises, anchored by the Dynamic Collateral Engine (DCE).

## Components
- **Intelligent Structuring**: Programmatic assessment of attested ERP data to determine principal limits and risk-adjusted coupons.
- **Dynamic Collateral Engine**: A non-liquidating stabilization layer that uses revenue interception (DCR < 130%) to maintain protocol solvency.
- **Revenue Automation**: Orchestrates the 0.1% Founder's Cut and automated top-ups.

## DCR Formula
$$DCR = \frac{OnChain\_Liq + Attested\_ERP\_Revenue}{Active\_Bonds \times Risk\_Multiplier}$$

## Synergy
The system resolves circular dependencies through a central `enterprise-data.clar` state store, ensuring clean architectural boundaries between the Access, Finance, and Connectivity units.
