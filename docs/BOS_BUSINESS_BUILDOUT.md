# BOS business buildout (conxian-business)

This document defines the business purpose and operating model for the public `conxian-business` repository, including:

- business-unit classification and placement
- a public-safe vs internal-only documentation split (Zero Secret Egress / ZSE)
- required governance + ownership + approval requirements
- a prioritized build/repair list

## Business-unit classification (repo placement)

**Classification:** Supporting repository (per `docs/REPO_PORTFOLIO.md`).

If the repo’s flagship/supporting placement changes in `docs/REPO_PORTFOLIO.md`, update this document in the same pull request.

**Business purpose (external/public):** provide a versioned, auditable trust surface for Conxian governance, OpenSpec requirements, and how the Conxian ecosystem repositories are coordinated.

**Business purpose (internal/operational):** serve as the canonical BOS (Business Operations System) baseline: a programmatic operating model (service loop + state machine artifacts) plus references to the EXCO agent-suite business units.

### What “lives” here (canonical surfaces)

| Surface | Primary location | Classification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenSpec (technical ground truth) | `openspec/` | Public-safe | Requirement definitions and spec-first change sets. |
| Governance and repo operating model | `GOVERNANCE.md`, `CODEOWNERS`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/` | Public-safe | How the repo is run and reviewed. |
| BOS operating model artifacts | `conxian-business/` | Mixed (default internal-only for automation/state-machine artifacts) | Service-loop narrative can be public-safe; automation/state-machine artifacts are internal-only unless explicitly reviewed for safe disclosure. |
| EXCO agent-suite business units | `Sovereign-Strategy-Nexus/`, `Fiscal-Vault-Oracle/`, `Nakamoto-Guardian/`, `Sovereign-Ops-Orchestrator/` | Mixed | Treat strategic/ops runbooks and any monetization/treasury specifics as internal-only by default. |
| Ecosystem repo map | `docs/REPO_PORTFOLIO.md` | Public-safe | Canonical “flagship vs supporting” placement. |
| Documentation classification index | `docs/DOCUMENTATION_ALIGNMENT_INDEX.md` | Public-safe | Canonical index of what exists + how it should be referenced/migrated. |

## Public/private split recommendation (ZSE)

Treat this repository as public for boundary purposes. (This GitHub repository is private as of April 8, 2026.) The split below defines what may be stored in Git and what must remain in an approved non-Git restricted-record system.

### Public-safe (keep in Git)

- OpenSpec requirements and design/spec documents that are intended as external ground truth.
- Governance docs, repo policies, and contribution requirements.
- Public product documentation and external-facing architecture/PRD material that has been scrubbed of privileged implementation details, secret formats, and exploit-enabling diagrams.
- Non-sensitive audits and public trust messaging.

### Restricted (store in an approved non-Git restricted-record system)

- **Strategic:** valuation framing, M\&A narratives, competitive positioning, partnership negotiation details, and time-bound roadmap milestones.
- **Legal:** contracts, entity structuring, jurisdiction-specific filings, and anything that increases legal exposure if copied out of context.
- **Operational:** incident response, deployment runbooks with privileged access steps, vendor account procedures, treasury execution specifics.
- **Administrative:** secret provisioning, identity access management, and any material that would meaningfully aid an attacker even without secret values.

### ZSE guardrails (repo rules)

1. Never commit secrets (values) or credential material.
2. If a restricted record must be acknowledged in GitHub, use only a non-descriptive `sha256(<64-lowercase-hex>)` commitment. Do not include a system name, location, access path, or sensitive metadata.
3. Treat “internal-only” as the default for:
   - strategy and treasury narratives
   - monetization and fee/royalty specifics
   - operational runbooks that describe privileged workflows

## Required docs (business, governance, ownership)

### Minimum public-safe set (this repository)

| Document | Requirement | Owner/approver |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `README.md` | Role line + purpose + pointers to canonical docs. Avoid internal strategy and operational detail. | Repo code owners (`CODEOWNERS`). |
| `docs/REPO_PORTFOLIO.md` | Canonical placement of this repo in the org trust surface. | Repo code owners. |
| `docs/DOCUMENTATION_ALIGNMENT_INDEX.md` | Canonical map of what docs exist, what is current, and what requires controlled migration. | Repo code owners. |
| `GOVERNANCE.md` | Governance model, ownership, and approval rules (high-level; no sensitive ops). | Repo code owners. |
| `CODEOWNERS` | Review + ownership routing. | Repo code owners. |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | GitHub-first public-safe contribution workflow and restricted-record stop rules. | Repo code owners. |
| `SECURITY.md` | Security policy and private reporting process. | Repo code owners. |
| `ARCHIVE_MIGRATION.md` | ZSE-safe pointer for legacy/removed material. | Repo code owners. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Public, versioned changes to BOS/OpenSpec policies and externally visible behavior. | Repo code owners. |

### Minimum restricted set

Maintain these only in an approved non-Git restricted-record system. GitHub may contain a non-descriptive commitment when necessary:

- Detailed BOS operating model semantics (privileged service-loop + state-machine runbooks; Git keeps only public-safe summaries and, when necessary, non-descriptive commitments).
- Privileged execution wiring between the state layer and repository automation.
- ZSE / knowledge retention policy and migration manifests.
- Secret management spec (procedural, privileged access).
- Strategy/legal/ops/admin material that cannot be safely versioned in public Git.

## Governance, ownership, and approval workflow (repo expectations)

1. All changes land via pull request.
2. Every pull request for public-safe work must link to the canonical GitHub issue in the owning repository.
3. `CODEOWNERS` review is required for any change.
4. Any change that redefines BOS boundaries, OpenSpec requirements, or the doc-classification policy must:
   - update `docs/DOCUMENTATION_ALIGNMENT_INDEX.md` where relevant, and
   - include a `CHANGELOG.md` entry when it changes externally visible behavior or expectations.
5. Restricted records must not be linked descriptively from Git. Use only a non-descriptive `sha256(<64-lowercase-hex>)` commitment when necessary.

## Prioritized build/repair list

1. Keep `README.md` aligned with the “supporting repo” role line and remove internal strategy/ops detail from the public entrypoint.
2. Keep `GOVERNANCE.md` as an explicit ownership + approval model tied to `CODEOWNERS` (not just a stub).
3. Treat `docs/DOCUMENTATION_ALIGNMENT_INDEX.md` as the canonical “doc registry” and keep it updated whenever docs are added, moved, or reclassified.
4. Migrate restricted documents that materially increase operational exposure to an approved non-Git restricted-record system, leaving no descriptive pointer in Git; use an opaque commitment only when necessary.

## 3. Branching and Promotion Policy (CON-381, CON-389)

To ensure the integrity of the Conxian Production Environment, all repositories in the portfolio must adhere to the branching and promotion policy defined in [`docs/BRANCHING_AND_PROMOTION_POLICY.md`](./BRANCHING_AND_PROMOTION_POLICY.md).

- **`main` branch**: Mainnet-only production code. No stubs, mocks, or placeholders.
- **`staged` branch**: Mainnet candidate validation. The only promotion branch for `main`.
- **`dev` branch**: Testnet-only and non-production validation.

Direct merges from `dev` to `main` are strictly prohibited.

## 4. SAB-owned BOS Wallet Architecture (CON-423)

To ensure system automation remains system-controlled, all flagship and supporting repositories must adhere to the wallet architecture defined in [`docs/SAB_WALLET_ARCHITECTURE_AND_CONTROL_MATRIX.md`](./SAB_WALLET_ARCHITECTURE_AND_CONTROL_MATRIX.md).

- **Execution Wallets**: Used for routine automation and BOS service loops.
- **Treasury Wallets**: Passive custody of protocol fees and reserves.
- **Payout Wallets**: Controlled by SAB-approved multi-sigs for bounties and royalties.

No launch-critical automation may depend on a personal or bootstrap wallet after the handoff to SAB-controlled custody (see [`SAB_DAO_HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md`](./SAB_DAO_HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md)).

## 5. The Sovereign Growth Flywheel (2026)

To scale the BOS ecosystem, Conxian implements the following strategic flywheels:

### Real Yield Flywheel
Inflationary tokens and "grant printing" are deprecated. We foster independence through:
- **Productive Streaming**: Independent labs earn a percentage of the Liquid Yield generated by the pools they manage.
- **Revenue-Backing**: Every agent on the platform is a revenue-generating node, earning micro-fees for state-proof verification and intent fulfillment.

### Agentic App Store
A specialized directory for autonomous agents:
- **Modular Specialization**: Labs publish specialized agents (e.g., Tax Compliance, Supply Chain Oracle).
- **Standardized Handshakes**: Using the ERP MCP Handshake, agents automatically detect and coordinate with each other out-of-the-box.

### Governance-Minimized Scaling
We scale without management bloat through **Policy-as-Code**:
- **Permissionless Onboarding**: No central committee approval required for building on the CNS Core.
- **Sovereign Guardrails**: Guardian wallets and time-locks enforce protocol-level safety while allowing local logic autonomy.
- **Auditable Logic**: All labs must publish their logic to ZSE-compliant public repositories.
