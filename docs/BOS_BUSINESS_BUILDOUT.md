# BOS business buildout (conxian-business)

This document defines the business purpose and operating model for the public `conxian-business` repository, including:

- business-unit classification and placement
- a public-safe vs internal-only documentation split (Zero Secret Egress / ZSE)
- required governance + ownership + approval requirements
- a prioritized build/repair list

> **Boundary notice:** Conxian-Labs is a non-custodial software and infrastructure provider. This document describes protocol, tenant, governance, and automation boundaries; it does not authorize company custody, SAB-controlled user funds, or discretionary fund management. User keys remain user-controlled, contract principals hold protocol state where applicable, DAO governance sets protocol policy, and regulated partners handle regulated custody.

## Business-unit classification (repo placement)

**Classification:** Supporting repository (per `docs/REPO_PORTFOLIO.md`).

If the repo’s flagship/supporting placement changes in `docs/REPO_PORTFOLIO.md`, update this document in the same pull request.

**Business purpose (external/public):** provide a versioned, auditable trust surface for Conxian governance, OpenSpec requirements, and how the Conxian ecosystem repositories are coordinated.

**Business purpose (internal/operational):** serve as the canonical BOS (Business Operations System) baseline: a programmatic operating model (service loop + state machine artifacts) plus references to the EXCO agent-suite business units.

### What “lives” here (canonical surfaces)

| Surface | Primary location | Classification | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| OpenSpec (technical ground truth) | `openspec/` | Public-safe | Requirement definitions and spec-first change sets. |
| Governance and repo operating model | `GOVERNANCE.md`, `CODEOWNERS`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.github/` | Public-safe | How the repo is run and reviewed. |
| BOS operating model artifacts | `conxian-business/` | Mixed (default internal-only for automation/state-machine artifacts) | Service-loop narrative can be public-safe; automation/state-machine artifacts are internal-only unless explicitly reviewed for safe disclosure. |
| EXCO agent-suite business units | `Sovereign-Strategy-Nexus/`, `Fiscal-Vault-Oracle/`, `Nakamoto-Guardian/`, `Sovereign-Ops-Orchestrator/` | Mixed | Treat strategic/ops runbooks and any monetization/treasury specifics as internal-only by default. |
| Ecosystem repo map | `docs/REPO_PORTFOLIO.md` | Public-safe | Canonical “flagship vs supporting” placement. |
| Documentation classification index | `docs/DOCUMENTATION_ALIGNMENT_INDEX.md` | Public-safe | Canonical index of what exists + how it should be referenced/migrated. |

## Public/private split recommendation (ZSE)

Treat this repository as public for boundary purposes. (This GitHub repository is private as of April 8, 2026.) The split below is a policy recommendation for what should be stored in Git vs stored in restricted vault/secure storage.

### Public-safe (keep in Git)

- OpenSpec requirements and design/spec documents that are intended as external ground truth.
- Governance docs, repo policies, and contribution requirements.
- Public product documentation and external-facing architecture/PRD material that has been scrubbed of privileged implementation details, secret formats, and exploit-enabling diagrams.
- Non-sensitive audits and public trust messaging.

### Internal-only (store in the authorized GitHub organization; reference from Git)

- **Strategic:** valuation framing, M\&A narratives, competitive positioning, partnership negotiation details, and time-bound roadmap milestones.
- **Legal:** contracts, entity structuring, jurisdiction-specific filings, and anything that increases legal exposure if copied out of context.
- **Operational:** incident response, deployment runbooks with privileged access steps, vendor account procedures, treasury execution specifics.
- **Administrative:** secret provisioning, identity access management, and any material that would meaningfully aid an attacker even without secret values.

### ZSE guardrails (repo rules)

1. Never commit secrets (values) or credential material.
2. If a document must be referenced but is internal-only, keep only:
   - a short public-safe summary, and
   - a pointer to the canonical GitHub document.
3. Treat “internal-only” as the default for:
   - strategy and treasury narratives
   - monetization and fee/royalty specifics
   - operational runbooks that describe privileged workflows

## Required docs (business, governance, ownership)

### Minimum public-safe set (this repository)

| Document | Requirement | Owner/approver |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `README.md` | Role line + purpose + pointers to canonical docs. Avoid internal strategy and operational detail. | Repo code owners (`CODEOWNERS`). |
| `docs/REPO_PORTFOLIO.md` | Canonical placement of this repo in the org trust surface. | Repo code owners. |
| `docs/DOCUMENTATION_ALIGNMENT_INDEX.md` | Canonical map of what docs exist + what’s canonical + what should be migrated to restricted vault/secure storage. | Repo code owners. |
| `GOVERNANCE.md` | Governance model, ownership, and approval rules (high-level; no sensitive ops). | Repo code owners. |
| `CODEOWNERS` | Review + ownership routing. | Repo code owners. |
| `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Contribution workflow and linking expectations (GitHub ↔ GitHub). | Repo code owners. |
| `SECURITY.md` | Security policy and private reporting process. | Repo code owners. |
| `ARCHIVE_MIGRATION.md` | ZSE-safe pointer for legacy/removed material. | Repo code owners. |
| `CHANGELOG.md` | Public, versioned changes to BOS/OpenSpec policies and externally visible behavior. | Repo code owners. |

### Minimum internal-only set (authorized GitHub organization)

Maintain these as GitHub documents (canonical for privileged detail), referenced from Git as needed:

- Detailed BOS operating model semantics (privileged service-loop + state-machine runbooks; Git keeps only public-safe summaries and pointers).
- Execution wiring: GitHub ↔ state layer ↔ repo automation.
- ZSE / knowledge retention policy and migration manifests.
- Secret management spec (procedural, privileged access).
- Strategy/legal/ops/admin material that cannot be safely versioned in public Git.

## Governance, ownership, and approval workflow (repo expectations)

1. All changes land via pull request.
2. Every pull request must link to a GitHub issue.
3. `CODEOWNERS` review is required for any change.
4. Any change that redefines BOS boundaries, OpenSpec requirements, or the doc-classification policy must:
   - update `docs/DOCUMENTATION_ALIGNMENT_INDEX.md` where relevant, and
   - include a `CHANGELOG.md` entry when it changes externally visible behavior or expectations.
5. Any internal-only material referenced from Git must point to restricted vault/secure storage as the canonical source.

## Prioritized build/repair list

1. Keep `README.md` aligned with the “supporting repo” role line and remove internal strategy/ops detail from the public entrypoint.
2. Keep `GOVERNANCE.md` as an explicit ownership + approval model tied to `CODEOWNERS` (not just a stub).
3. Treat `docs/DOCUMENTATION_ALIGNMENT_INDEX.md` as the canonical “doc registry” and keep it updated whenever docs are added, moved, or reclassified.
4. Migrate internal-only documents that materially increase operational exposure to restricted vault/secure storage, leaving behind only ZSE-safe summaries and links.

## 3. Branching and Promotion Policy (CON-381, CON-389)

To ensure the integrity of the Conxian Production Environment, all repositories in the portfolio must adhere to the branching and promotion policy defined in [`docs/BRANCHING_AND_PROMOTION_POLICY.md`](./BRANCHING_AND_PROMOTION_POLICY.md).

- **`main` branch**: Mainnet-only production code. No stubs, mocks, or placeholders.
- **`staged` branch**: Mainnet candidate validation. The only promotion branch for `main`.
- **`dev` branch**: Testnet-only and non-production validation.

Direct merges from `dev` to `main` are strictly prohibited.

## 4. BOS wallet architecture: bounded protocol controls (CON-423)

To ensure system automation remains system-controlled, all flagship and supporting repositories must adhere to the wallet architecture defined in [`docs/SAB_WALLET_ARCHITECTURE_AND_CONTROL_MATRIX.md`](./SAB_WALLET_ARCHITECTURE_AND_CONTROL_MATRIX.md).

- **Execution signers**: Used for routine automation and BOS service loops within explicit permissions.
- **Protocol-vault controls**: Contract-held protocol fees and reserves governed by on-chain rules; this is not Conxian-Labs custody.
- **Payout signers**: SAB-approved multi-sigs may authorize protocol-defined bounties and royalties; they are not discretionary fund managers.

No launch-critical automation may depend on a personal or bootstrap wallet after the handoff to SAB-approved protocol control paths (see [`SAB_DAO_HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md`](./SAB_DAO_HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md)).

## 5. The Sovereign Growth Flywheel (2026)

To scale the BOS ecosystem, Conxian implements the following strategic flywheels:

### Real Yield Flywheel (target-state protocol framing)
Inflationary tokens and "grant printing" are deprecated. We foster independence through:
- **Productive Streaming**: Target-state protocol rules may allocate a documented share of contract-defined yield to participating labs.
- **Revenue-Backing**: Target-state protocol rules may allocate micro-fees for state-proof verification and intent fulfillment; this is not a company revenue or managed-fund promise.

### Agentic App Store
A specialized directory for autonomous agents:
- **Modular Specialization**: Labs publish specialized agents (e.g., Tax Compliance, Supply Chain Oracle).
- **Standardized Handshakes**: Using the ERP MCP Handshake, agents automatically detect and coordinate with each other out-of-the-box.

### Governance-Minimized Scaling
We scale without management bloat through **Policy-as-Code**:
- **Permissionless Onboarding**: No central committee approval required for building on the CNS Core.
- **Sovereign Guardrails**: User-controlled signers, contract principals, and time-locks enforce protocol-level safety while allowing local logic autonomy.
- **Auditable Logic**: All labs must publish their logic to ZSE-compliant public repositories.
