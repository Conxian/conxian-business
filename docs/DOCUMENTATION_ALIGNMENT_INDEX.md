# Documentation alignment index (conxian-business)

This page is a practical index of the documentation already present in this repository, focused on helping active work reference existing material instead of recreating it.

## Classification rules

- **Canonical**: the current “source of truth” for a domain. If two docs disagree, update the non-canonical doc to match the canonical one.
- **Supporting**: helpful context, audits, reports, briefs, or deep dives that clarify (but don’t define) the system.
- **Public-safe**: ok to link in public contexts and external conversations.
- **Public-safe stub (canonical in Linear)**: safe to link publicly; this repo file is a short pointer stub (see `docs/templates/ZSE_STUB_TEMPLATE.md`), and the full operational, security, financial, legal, and strategic detail is maintained in Linear under ZSE.
- **Internal-only (canonical in Linear only)**: operational / security / financial / legal / strategic material whose canonical document must live only in the Conxian Linear workspace. If a repo link target must be preserved, use a **Public-safe stub (canonical in Linear)** (see [ZSE stub template](./templates/ZSE_STUB_TEMPLATE.md)) so existing links continue to resolve.

Notes:

- This repo is public. “Internal-only” material should not be stored here; when we preserve link targets we use public-safe ZSE stubs (see https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-256).
- OpenSpec change sets typically have 4 layers: `proposal.md` (intent), `design.md` (architecture), `specs/*/spec.md` (requirements), `tasks.md` (execution).

## 2) BOS (Business Operations System)

These are the “operating-model” documents that explain how BOS components relate, how execution is intended to be wired into Linear, and what gets measured.

## 7) Known doc gaps / broken references (should not be re-created blindly)

These are referenced by current docs but are not present in the active Git index. Before recreating them from scratch, first check whether they were intentionally migrated to the Linear Virtual Office under ZSE.

- `docs/STRATEGOS_MANDATE.md` (referenced by `audit/strategos-alignment.md`, `Fiscal-Vault-Oracle/SOVEREIGN_RUNWAY.md`).
- `system_ip_audit.md` (referenced by `Sovereign-Strategy-Nexus/REALTIME_M&A_VELOCITY.md`).
- `RENDER_BOS_PAYLOAD.md` (referenced by `audit/nomenclature-alignment.md`).
- `Sovereign-Strategy-Nexus/SARB_MANDATE.md` (referenced by `audit/strategos-alignment.md`).

## 8) Issue-linking recommendations (current CON issues)

If an issue is in a planning or execution state, the description should link to the doc(s) below so the “why/spec” stays stable even as implementation details change.

| Issue | Add links to | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-343 | `openspec/changes/sovereign-data-migration-institutional-egress/specs.md`, `openspec/changes/sovereign-data-migration-institutional-egress/specs/sovereign-data-migration-institutional-egress/spec.md`, `ARCHIVE_MIGRATION.md` | This issue is spec-first and directly tied to ZSE + migration. |
| https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-158 | `docs/DOCUMENTATION_ALIGNMENT_INDEX.md`, `SUMMARY.md`, `openspec/changes/remediate-enterprise-sovereignty/specs.md` | This is the “alignment” umbrella; it should anchor to the index + baseline OpenSpec. |
| https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-152 | `conxian-business/SERVICE_LOOP.md`, `Sovereign-Ops-Orchestrator/LINEAR_WIRING.md`, `conxian-business/BOS_STATE_MACHINE.stub.json` | BOS operating model work should reference the service loop + wiring + state machine. |
| https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-157 | `Conxian/PRD.md`, `conxian-gateway/PRD.md`, `conxian-nexus/docs/PRD.md` | “Business-unit model” extraction should start from PRDs (what exists and how it’s separated). |
| https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-160 | `conxian-gateway/PRD.md`, `lib-conxian-core/docs/PRD.md`, `openspec/changes/remediate-enterprise-sovereignty/specs/enterprise-sovereignty/spec.md` | Settlement ingress touches gateway/core-lib conventions + sovereignty requirements. |
| https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-131 | `docs/bounties/MAINTAINER_PAYOUT_ENABLEMENT_RUNBOOK.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Bounty workflow should reference the payout runbook + repo workflow norms. |
| https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-325 | `admin/SECRETS.md`, `ARCHIVE_MIGRATION.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md` (ZSE section) | Secrets removal work should anchor to the ZSE “where is it now?” docs. |
| https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-326 | `openspec/specs/git-management/spec.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Repo discipline/categorization should cite the OpenSpec git rules + contributing norms. |
| https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-327 | `openspec/specs/git-management/spec.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `.github/*` templates | Governance standardization needs the existing governance/security baselines. |
