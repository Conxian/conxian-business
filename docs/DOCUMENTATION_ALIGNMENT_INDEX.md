# Documentation alignment index (conxian-business)

This page is a practical index of the documentation already present in this repository, focused on helping active work reference existing material instead of recreating it.

Portfolio doctrine is defined centrally in [`DOCTRINE_ALIGNMENT_STANDARD.md`](./DOCTRINE_ALIGNMENT_STANDARD.md) and [`PORTFOLIO_DOCTRINE_REGISTER.md`](./PORTFOLIO_DOCTRINE_REGISTER.md). This index is navigation and document disposition only; it must not introduce a competing role, maturity, claim-state, or classification taxonomy.

## Classification rules

- **Canonical**: the current “source of truth” for a domain. If two docs disagree, update the non-canonical doc to match the canonical one.
- **Supporting**: helpful context, audits, reports, briefs, or deep dives that clarify (but don’t define) the system.
- **Public-safe**: ok to link in public contexts and external conversations.
- **Public-safe stub (canonical in Sovereign Coordination Layer)**: safe to link publicly; this repo file is a short pointer stub (see [ZSE stub template](./templates/ZSE_STUB_TEMPLATE.md)). It must not contain any operational, security, financial, legal, and strategic details beyond the pointer. The full canonical content is maintained in the sovereign coordination layer under ZSE.
- **Internal-only (canonical in Sovereign Coordination Layer only)**: operational, security, financial, legal, and strategic material whose canonical document must live only in the sovereign coordination layer. If a repo link target must be preserved, use a **Public-safe stub (canonical in Sovereign Coordination Layer)** (see [ZSE stub template](./templates/ZSE_STUB_TEMPLATE.md)) so existing links continue to resolve.

Notes:

- Treat this repo as public for boundary purposes. (This GitHub repository is private as of April 8, 2026.) "Internal-only" material should not be stored here; when we preserve link targets we use public-safe ZSE stubs (see sovereign coordination layer issue CON-256).
- OpenSpec change sets typically have 4 layers: `proposal.md` (intent), `design.md` (architecture), `specs/*/spec.md` (requirements), `tasks.md` (execution).

### Archival candidates

- `docs/LINEAR_TASK_INVENTORY_2026-05-29.md` — date-stamped task snapshot; planning source of truth now lives in active work systems and canonical policy docs.
- `docs/RESEARCH_FINDINGS_2026-05-29.md` — point-in-time findings snapshot superseded by maintained canonical docs and OpenSpec changes.
- `docs/BUSINESS_ANALYSIS_2026-05-29.md` — dated analysis snapshot that risks drift against current canonical portfolio/control docs.

## 1) Repo navigation (start here)

## 2) BOS (Business Operations System)

These are the operating-model documents that explain how BOS components relate, how public-safe GitHub-native execution is coordinated, and what gets measured. Historical migration issue [#944](https://github.com/Conxian/conxian-business/issues/944) inventories legacy workspace references without creating active intake authority; do not mechanically rewrite historical stubs.

## 7) Known doc gaps / broken references (should not be re-created blindly)

These are referenced by current docs but are not present in the active Git index. Before recreating them from scratch, first check whether they were intentionally migrated to the Linear Virtual Office under ZSE.

- `docs/STRATEGOS_MANDATE.md` (referenced by `audit/strategos-alignment.md`, `Fiscal-Vault-Oracle/SOVEREIGN_RUNWAY.md`).
- `system_ip_audit.md` (referenced by `Sovereign-Strategy-Nexus/REALTIME_M&A_VELOCITY.md`).
- `RENDER_BOS_PAYLOAD.md` (referenced by `audit/nomenclature-alignment.md`).
- `Sovereign-Strategy-Nexus/SARB_MANDATE.md` (referenced by `audit/strategos-alignment.md`).

## 8) Historical Linear issue-linking provenance

The table below is a dated archive of pre-2026-07-26 Linear linkage recommendations. It is historical/migration context only. Do not create or update Linear items from this table; active work must use authoritative GitHub issues and pull requests.

| Issue | Add links to | Why |
| --- | --- | --- |
| https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-343 | `openspec/changes/sovereign-data-migration-sovereign-egress/specs.md`, `openspec/changes/sovereign-data-migration-sovereign-egress/specs/sovereign-data-migration-sovereign-egress/spec.md`, `ARCHIVE_MIGRATION.md` | This issue is spec-first and directly tied to ZSE + migration. |
| https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-158 | `docs/DOCUMENTATION_ALIGNMENT_INDEX.md`, `SUMMARY.md`, `openspec/changes/remediate-enterprise-sovereignty/specs.md` | This is the “alignment” umbrella; it should anchor to the index + baseline OpenSpec. |
| https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-152 | `conxian-business/SERVICE_LOOP.md`, `Sovereign-Ops-Orchestrator/LINEAR_WIRING.md`, `conxian-business/BOS_STATE_MACHINE.stub.json` | Historical mapping only. Current public-safe BOS work follows `docs/GITHUB_FIRST_BOS_OPERATING_MODEL.md`; the wiring file is retained solely as #944 migration evidence. |
| https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-157 | `Conxian/PRD.md`, `conxian-gateway/PRD.md`, `conxian-nexus/docs/PRD.md` | “Business-unit model” extraction should start from PRDs (what exists and how it’s separated). |
| https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-160 | `conxian-gateway/PRD.md`, `lib-conxian-core/docs/PRD.md`, `openspec/changes/remediate-enterprise-sovereignty/specs/enterprise-sovereignty/spec.md` | Settlement ingress touches gateway/core-lib conventions + sovereignty requirements. |
| https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-780 | `docs/operations/CON-780_LIGHTNING_COVERAGE_TRACKER.md`, `docs/architecture/BITCOIN_LAYER_ARCHITECTURE_BOUNDARY_NOTE.md`, `docs/COMPATIBILITY_MATRIX_AND_ACCEPTANCE_GATE_CHECKLIST.md` | GAP-009 Lightning coverage execution should anchor to the active tracker, service/adapter ownership boundary, and shared acceptance-gate criteria. |
| https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-131 | `docs/bounties/MAINTAINER_PAYOUT_ENABLEMENT_RUNBOOK.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Bounty workflow should reference the payout runbook + repo workflow norms. |
| https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-325 | `admin/SECRETS.md`, `ARCHIVE_MIGRATION.md`, `docs/AGENTS.md` (ZSE section) | Secrets removal work should anchor to the ZSE “where is it now?” docs. |
| https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-326 | `openspec/specs/git-management/spec.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md` | Repo discipline/categorization should cite the OpenSpec git rules + contributing norms. |
| https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-327 | `openspec/specs/git-management/spec.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `.github/*` templates | Governance standardization needs the existing governance/security baselines. |

## 9) Archived Linear migration proposals

This dated proposal list is retained as migration history. Do not create these as new canonical Linear documents. It does not define current intake, status, traceability, or an approved restricted-record system. Current public-safe coordination follows `docs/GITHUB_FIRST_BOS_OPERATING_MODEL.md`; #944 governs each remaining reference.

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `docs/DEVELOPER_QUICKSTART.md` | Canonical | Public-safe | Ecosystem architecture, submodule map, build/test commands for all 4 suites, CI/CD pipeline, promotion workflow, and contribution guide. |
| `docs/BOUNDARY_DECISION_LOG.md` | Canonical | Public-safe | Systematic boundary register classifying 20+ artifacts (strategy, BOS state, architecture, bounties, CI/CD) as public-safe, public-safe stub, or internal-only. |
| `docs/TRUST_AND_READINESS_VERIFICATION.md` | Canonical | Public-safe | Evaluator-facing trust audit of 5 flagship repos against implementation truth. Separates implemented, verified, production-ready, and target-state. Defines explicit non-claim boundary. |
| `docs/TRUST_AND_PROOF_MESSAGING.md` | Canonical | Public-safe | Standard framework for trust signals on public surfaces (security posture, governance, repo maturity, release discipline, audience fit, portfolio boundaries). |
| `docs/OPERATING_LANE_BOUNDARIES.md` | Canonical | Public-safe | Explicit lane boundaries for Packaging (doctrine), GTM (execution), and Operations (coordination). Includes escalation paths, anti-patterns, and cross-lane operating loop. |
| `docs/operations/WEEKLY_GROWTH_DRIVER_REVIEW.md` | Canonical | Public-safe | Weekly GTM metrics review template covering qualified conversations, demos, pilots, proofs, and responsiveness. Cross-references BOS operational metrics (CON-682). |
| `docs/TECHNICAL_WHITEPAPER_OUTLINE.md` | Canonical | Public-safe | 10-section flagship whitepaper outline with evidence references: system architecture, BOS state machine, security model, protocol layer, execution layer, compliance layer, client layer. |
| `docs/COMMERCIAL_PACKAGING_DOCTRINE.md` | Canonical | Public-safe | Offer structure (Gateway/Wallet/SDK), 3-tier packaging matrix, pricing doctrine, customer journey stages, pilot path, and executive one-pager template (pricing details in Linear per ZSE). |
