# Deployment verification matrix (runtime lanes)

This document defines a **minimum** verification baseline for validating **packaging changes** (build/release/deploy surface) across the Conxian runtime lanes.

Goal: ensure changes that affect artifacts (lockfiles, build scripts, containers, deployment manifests, CI, submodules) can be promoted consistently **before pilot use**.

## Definitions

- **Packaging change**: any change that can alter a deployable artifact or its provenance. Common examples:
  - CI workflows (`.github/workflows/*`)
  - repo hygiene / verification scripts (`scripts/*`)
  - lockfiles (`Cargo.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`, submodule pins)
  - container build or runtime packaging (`Dockerfile*`, compose/k8s manifests)
  - release/promotion policy or artifact-provenance documentation (e.g. `docs/BRANCH_*`, release hygiene docs, evidence-pack specs under `openspec/specs/*`)
- **Runtime lane**: the environment branch + deployment context used for validation and promotion:
  - `dev`: testnet-only and non-production validation
  - `staged`: mainnet candidate validation
  - `main`: mainnet-only production

Reference: `docs/BRANCH_AND_PROMOTION_STANDARD.md`.

## Matrix (summary)

The table below is intentionally compact; details are defined in the lane sections that follow.

| Lane | Build | Test | Security | Upgrade | Rollback | Verification outputs |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `dev` | Deterministic artifact build; dependency pins intentional | CI green + testnet smoke where applicable | Secret scan + dependency review clean | Upgrade path rehearsed (non-prod) | Rollback rehearsed (non-prod) | CI run link + artifact digests + smoke evidence |
| `staged` | Same as `dev`, plus mainnet-candidate build parity | CI green + candidate smoke + migration checks | Secret scan + dependency review clean; no testnet residue in production paths | Roll-forward rehearsed with prod-like config | Rollback exercised in controlled candidate env | Candidate validation notes + residue scans + pre-evidence pack |
| `main` | Reproducible production artifacts | Required checks green | Full mainnet acceptance evidence pack | Production upgrade is policy-guarded | Production rollback trigger + last-known-good proven | Evidence pack + commit SHA → artifact digest map |

## Lane criteria

### Lane: `dev` (testnet / non-production)

**Build**

- CI must build from a clean checkout (and, if the repo uses submodules, `actions/checkout` + `submodules: recursive`).
- Any dependency pin changes are explicit (lockfiles, submodule SHAs) and reviewable.
- If submodule SHAs change, record the old/new SHAs in the PR description (or other lane evidence notes) and include the relevant boundary/contamination check output.

**Test**

- All always-on PR checks are green.
- If the packaging change affects a runtime path, a lane-appropriate smoke test is executed against testnet/non-prod.

**Security**

- Secret scanning and dependency review checks are green.
- No new privileged control-plane assumptions are introduced (keep credentials scoped and capability-based).

**Upgrade**

- If the change requires an upgrade step (migrations, config changes), that step is documented public-safely (no secrets, no signer procedures).

**Rollback**

- A last-known-good artifact exists (tag, digest, or commit SHA) and can be redeployed in the same lane.

**Verification outputs (minimum evidence)**

- PR link + CI run link for the change.
- Artifact identity proof (at least one of): container image digest, binary checksum, or commit SHA → artifact mapping.

### Lane: `staged` (mainnet candidate validation)

This lane is where packaging changes become **pilot-ready** for mainnet-candidate environments.

**Build**

- Same requirements as `dev`.
- Build parity checks: artifacts must be built using the same build system and dependency pins intended for `main`.

**Test**

- All always-on PR checks are green.
- Any repo/business-unit suite relevant to the change scope must run (see `docs/RELEASE_HYGIENE_CONXIAN_NEXUS.md`).
- Candidate smoke test(s) run in a prod-like configuration where feasible (without leaking operational details into git).

**Security**

- Secret scanning and dependency review checks (where enabled) are green for the promotion candidate commit.
- No “testnet defaults” remain in production paths.
- No new stub, mock, placeholder, or debug-only behavior is introduced in any path that can reach `main`.

**Upgrade**

- Upgrade steps are compatible with mainnet-candidate rollout (idempotent, replay-safe, and observable).
- Any schema/migration step must have explicit ownership and a failure mode that fails closed.

**Rollback**

- Rollback steps are validated in a controlled candidate environment at least once.
- Rollback does not depend on private or personal wallets; it must use operational/system authorities.

**Verification outputs (minimum evidence)**

- CI run link + residue scan or boundary-check output (for example, checks under `scripts/` such as `python3 scripts/verify_contamination_guard.py` or other `python3 scripts/verify_*.py`, where applicable), recorded in the PR description (or linked evidence notes).
- Candidate smoke test evidence (CI job output link preferred), recorded alongside the CI run link. If manual commands are recorded, they MUST be sanitized/redacted (no endpoints, credentials, identifiers, or operational procedures) and stored outside git (e.g., internal runbooks).
- Artifact digest / checksum and the exact commit SHA the artifact was built from.

### Lane: `main` (mainnet production)

This lane is only for production-ready promotions.

**Build / Test / Security**

- Required checks are green for the exact promotion candidate commit.
- Promotion follows the ordered path `dev` -> `staged` -> `main`.

**Upgrade / Rollback / Verification**

- A `staged` -> `main` promotion MUST include a Mainnet Acceptance Evidence Pack.
- The evidence pack is the canonical record for:
  - contamination/residue proof (no stubs/mocks/testnet residue)
  - upgrade notes (if any)
  - rollback trigger + last-known-good rebuild path

Reference (canonical): `openspec/specs/mainnet-acceptance-evidence-pack/spec.md`.

## Notes

- This matrix defines a **minimum** baseline; business-unit specific readiness gates still apply (e.g., SAB pilot readiness gates in `docs/SAB_MIGRATION_READINESS_GATES.md`).
- Keep ZSE constraints: no secrets, signer identities, private endpoints, or operational procedures in git.
