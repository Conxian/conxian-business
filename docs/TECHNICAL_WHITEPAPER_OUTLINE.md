## Purpose

This document is the outline for the flagship Conxian technical whitepaper. The finished whitepaper will serve as the single authoritative technical artifact for evaluators, advanced partners, and technical diligence — explaining the full system without requiring repo-by-repo reading.

**Target audience**: Technical evaluators, compliance reviewers, institutional partners, advanced developers, and security auditors.

**Design principles for the finished paper**:
- Implemented vs target-state distinctions are explicit in every section
- Protocol, support, business, and public-interface layers are clearly separated
- Trust boundaries and dependencies are explicit
- Zero-custody, zero-raw-data doctrine is preserved throughout
- Claims are evidence-backed (each claim references a verifiable artifact)

## Outline

### Abstract (150 words)

- What Conxian is: A sovereign-first, non-custodial financial operating system built directly on Bitcoin
- Core innovation: BOS (Business Operations System) as a programmatic state machine with cryptographic proof of correct operation
- Key differentiators: Hardware-enforced sovereignty (TEE/StrongBox), Zero Secret Egress, BitVM2-verified cross-chain state, ISO 20022 compliance without custody
- Current maturity: Conxius Wallet (Stable), Nexus (Beta), Gateway (Beta), ConxianCSF (pre-mainnet, gated on ALEX funding)

> **Evidence**: [TRUST_AND_READINESS_VERIFICATION.md]

### 1) Introduction & Motivation (2 pages)

#### 1.1 The Sovereignty Gap
- Existing financial infrastructure: custodial by default, centralized trust anchors
- Bitcoin solves monetary sovereignty; does not solve operational sovereignty
- The gap: enterprises need Bitcoin-native financial operations without surrendering key custody

#### 1.2 Design Philosophy
- Sovereignty by Design: cryptographic keys never leave user hardware
- Zero Secret Egress: sensitive logic in secure enclaves, not in source code
- Fail-Closed: every privileged workflow must prove validity or abort
- Open-Core: core protocols and verification are public; operational runbooks are internal

#### 1.3 Scope of This Paper
- What is covered: system architecture, protocol layers, trust model, security invariants, current implementation state
- What is not covered: detailed API reference, deployment runbooks, pricing, forward-looking roadmap commitments

### 2) System Architecture (4 pages)

#### 2.1 The Five-Plane Model
- **Bitcoin Settlement Plane**: L1 finality, BitVM2 verification, DLC bonds
- **Protocol Plane**: Clarity smart contracts (CSF), sovereign treasury, fiscal vault oracle
- **Execution Plane**: Nexus multi-protocol engine (Bitcoin, EVM, Cosmos, Stacks, Lightning, RGB)
- **Compliance Plane**: Gateway ISO 20022 pipeline, ZKC (Zero-Knowledge Compliance)
- **Client Plane**: Conxius Wallet (StrongBox/TEE), `conxian_ui` (dashboard)

> **Evidence**: [THREE_LANE_RUNTIME_DEPLOYMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md §3]

#### 2.2 Three Deployment Lanes
- Community sovereign-node (self-hosted)
- Business-managed (managed hosting + shared controls)
- Enterprise / private-cloud (customer-operated control plane)

> **Evidence**: [THREE_LANE_RUNTIME_DEPLOYMENT_ARCHITECTURE.md]

#### 2.3 Cross-Chain State Verification
- MMR (Merkle Mountain Range) proofs for state root commitments
- BitVM2 Groth16 verification for Bitcoin L1 state
- Protocol adapters: EVM receipt verification, Cosmos IBC update verification, Stacks transaction verification

> **Evidence**: [conxian-nexus/src/api/rest.rs], [lib-conxian-core]

#### 2.4 Ecosystem Repository Map

### 3) The BOS: Business Operations as a State Machine (3 pages)

#### 3.1 Unified Theory v2.0
- Four governing variables: C_R (Cost of Reproduction), O_C (Opportunity Cost), V_X (Execution Velocity), A_S (System Autonomy)
- Four-phase lifecycle: Genesis → Forge → Transition → Sovereign State
- Current phase: Transition (Phase 3), driving O_C → 0

> **Evidence**: [CONXIAN_UNIFIED_THEORY_v2.md]

#### 3.2 Programmatic Governance
- Promotion pipeline: dev → staged → main with CI enforcement
- Contamination guard: zero hardcoded testnet principals in production contracts
- Sovereign-First Deployment Mandate: dynamic principals via operational-treasury.clar

> **Evidence**: [AGENTS.md § Sovereign-First Deployment Mandate], [verify_contamination_guard.py]

#### 3.3 Operational Metrics
- C_R: Structural moat (TEE coverage × Clarity complexity × compliance integration)
- O_C: Manual overhead on critical-path workflows
- V_X: AI and tooling leverage (completed weighted scope / median cycle time)
- A_S: Automated recurring runs / total recurring runs
- N_E: Network effects (participant uplift)

> **Evidence**: [CON-682_APPROVED_METRIC_SPEC.md]

---

### 4) Security & Trust Model (3 pages)

#### 4.1 Cryptographic Sovereignty
- Hardware-enforced key custody: Android StrongBox, TPM 2.0, TEE
- Attestation-gated access: verifiable attestation chain before session issuance
- Short-lived, capability-scoped session credentials
- No bearer tokens for privileged surfaces

> **Evidence**: [BOS_SOVEREIGN_ENTERPRISE_IDENTITY_ARCHITECTURE.md]

#### 4.2 Zero Secret Egress (ZSE)
- Three-layer rule: Secrets → Linear/Supabase; On-chain → State-proof primitives only; Stubs → fail-closed with `err-u501` / `err-u503`
- Contamination guard: production-track .clar files scanned for testnet/simnet principals; build breaks on violation

> **Evidence**: [AGENTS.md § ZSE], [BOUNDARY_DECISION_LOG.md]

#### 4.3 Trust Boundaries
- What is claimed: verifiable CI pipeline, ZSE compliance, cryptographic proof of state, honest maturity labeling
- What is NOT claimed: third-party audits, production SLAs, full decentralization, payable bug bounties

> **Evidence**: [TRUST_AND_READINESS_VERIFICATION.md §4]

#### 4.4 Supply Chain Integrity
- Submodule pin integrity audit (daily)
- Action version audit (all GitHub Actions SHA-pinned)
- LTS compliance verification
- Repo hygiene suite (ZSE + submodules)

## Writing Notes

### For each section when drafting:
1. **Start with the implementation state** — what exists today, not what is planned
2. **Mark target-state elements explicitly** — "[Target-state]" prefix for anything not yet implemented
3. **Reference evidence** — every architectural claim links to a public artifact (source file, CI run, spec)
4. **Honest about maturity** — use the status taxonomy: Incubating, Beta, Stable, Deprecated
5. **ZSE compliance** — no secrets, no operational runbooks, no privileged identifiers

### Sections that need additional research before drafting:
- §5.2 Oracle economics and PPP methodology (currently stub in Git; canonical in Linear)
- §7.2 SYI pricing model details (implementation detail in Linear)
- §8.2 Complete protocol integration matrix (needs wallet team input)
- §5.3 Fiscal vault mechanics (canonical in Linear per ZSE)

### Target length: 25-30 pages (including diagrams and appendices)
