# Repo portfolio (flagship vs supporting)

This page defines the Conxian public repo map for external evaluation and internal consistency.

For the portfolio-level business-unit/operating-function mapping (and separation-of-concerns rules), see [Portfolio business-unit map and separation of concerns](./PORTFOLIO_BUSINESS_UNIT_MAP.md).

- Repos governed via this BOS repo are pinned as submodule gitlinks (configured in `.gitmodules`).
- Every pinned submodule must be mapped in `docs/PORTFOLIO_BUSINESS_UNIT_MAP.md`.
- This file is an explanatory trust-surface view and must not introduce governed repos that aren’t both pinned and mapped.

## Standard role line (GitHub description + README top section)

Use the same single **role line** in both the GitHub repo description (plain text; keep it concise—aim for ~160 chars) and the README “top section” (right below the opening paragraph). You may add a separate README-only line below it (for example, a link to this repo portfolio). The 1-line purposes should match the descriptions in the [Ecosystem repos](#ecosystem-repos) section.

- Flagship:
  - `Flagship — <1-line purpose>`
- Supporting:
  - `Supporting — <1-line purpose>`

> Maintainers: Prefer linking back to this file from flagship READMEs:
> <https://github.com/Conxian/conxian-business/blob/main/docs/REPO_PORTFOLIO.md#ecosystem-repos>
> Only copy the `## Ecosystem repos` section verbatim when you need a fully self-contained README, and keep that copy in sync whenever this section changes.
