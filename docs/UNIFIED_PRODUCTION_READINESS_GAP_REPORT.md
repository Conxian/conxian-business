## 1. Executive Summary

> **Current autonomy posture (2026-08-22):** Full M2M/autonomous readiness is **not certified**. The canonical, capability-scoped gap ledger is [`audit/m2m_autonomy_gap_ledger.json`](../audit/m2m_autonomy_gap_ledger.json), enforced by `scripts/verify_m2m_autonomy_readiness.py`. It records identity handshake evidence, durable orchestration, asset-signing conditions, reproducible labs, and KB contradiction controls as `Not Run`, `Incubating`, `Conditional`, or `Conditional`; these statuses must not be promoted to production claims without executable evidence.

Conxian Labs has **10 active sub-repositories** plus the **conxian-business** orchestration repo. After a comprehensive audit across all repos — examining PRDs, BOS Buildout docs, Mainnet Readiness assessments, architecture docs, source code, GitHub issues, and market research — the ecosystem presents a **paradox**:

- **At the time of this 2026-06-03 report, Mainnet Readiness documents** all asserted "READY FOR MAINNET" (Wallet v1.6.0, Gateway v0.1.1, Protocol v0.6.2, Enclave SDK v1.6.0)
- **BOS Buildout docs** identify significant P0 gaps across all repos
- **PRD documents** claim 39/39 requirements COMPLETE for Gateway, REC-006 CLOSED for Protocol
- **Source code analysis** reveals production-grade implementations (BitVM2 Groth16 verification, ISO 20022 XML generation, TEE enclave attestation, DLC oracle integration)
- **Market data** confirms strong product-market timing (BTCFi resurgence, PAPSS 2.0 launch, RegTech $234B market)

**Historical 2026-06-03 verdict: TECHNICALLY PRODUCTION-READY, OPERATIONALLY GAPPED.** The core technology was assessed as real and shipping at report time. The documented gaps were operational readiness — release hygiene, submodule integrity, documentation alignment, test coverage, and control-plane orchestration. This historical verdict does not supersede the current SDK audit.

## 3. Repository-by-Repository Assessment

### 3.1 Conxian Protocol (`Conxian/`)

| Dimension | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Total contracts** | 219 `.clar` files across 39 directories |
| **Active implementation** | ~40 production contracts (treasury, DEX, DLC, compliance, NFT, bridge) |
| **Stub contracts** | ~178 listed in `STUB_CONTRACTS.md` (Feb 2026), but **most now implemented** — REC-006 closed April 2026 |
| **True remaining stubs** | ~6–12 minimal files (<150 bytes, no real logic) |
| **Clarity 4 migration** | ✅ Complete — all 207 contracts migrated per changelog |
| **PRD claims** | 13 sections, REC-006 CLOSED, all key requirements COMPLETE |
| **Gas benchmarks** | DEX swap ~45k, Treasury ~30k, Compliance ~25k |
| **Gaps** | `STUB_CONTRACTS.md` is stale (last updated Feb 2026); needs refresh or archival. Mainnet release plan needs standardization (CON-371) |

**Verdict: PRODUCTION READY** — Core contracts are real, Clarity 4 complete, gas benchmarks healthy. Stale documentation is the only real gap.

### 3.2 Conxian Fusion (`conxian-gateway/`)

| Dimension | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Workspaces** | 4-crate workspace (internal/, attpcrypto/, atat/, core/) |
| **Rust files** | 34+ files across compliance, engine, NTT, A2P modules |
| **PRD requirements** | 39/39 **COMPLETE** — ISO 20022, BitVM2, WIF, CJCS v2.0, ALEX DEX, A2P, NTT |
| **ISO 20022** | ✅ `pacs.008` XML generation in `zkc.rs` — real implementation |
| **BitVM2** | ✅ Groth16 proof verification via `lib-conxian-core` — production code |
| **ZKC** | ✅ Zero-Knowledge Compliance — identity verification, transaction monitoring |
| **BOS Buildout** | ~90%+ gaps closed |
| **Gaps** | NTT crate (`ntt/mod.rs`) is functional but could benefit from expanded integration tests |

**Verdict: PRODUCTION READY** — The Gateway is the most mature subrepo. All 39 PRD requirements verified as implemented in source code.

### 3.3 Conxian Nexus (`conxian-nexus/`)

| Dimension | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Rust files** | 37+ files across services, models, gRPC, admin |
| **Architecture** | Glass Node — state mirroring, FSOC sequencer, MMR persistence |
| **Stacks coverage** | 78/81 (96%) — BOS Buildout |
| **Bitcoin coverage** | 39/49 (80%) — BOS Buildout |
| **Lightning coverage** | 33/49 (67%) — BOS Buildout |
| **BitVM integration** | ✅ Calls `lib_conxian_core::bitvm2::verify_state_root_bn254_groth16` — real verification |
| **PRD v0.4.7** | Glass Node, FSOC, Sovereign Handoff implemented. BitVM integration listed as "Next Step" (partially resolved) |
| **Gaps** | Bitcoin and Lightning coverage below 85%. Mempool monitoring for MEV is "Next Step." Documentation needs expansion |

**Verdict: BETA QUALITY** — Stacks coverage excellent. Bitcoin/Lightning need work. FSOC sequencer functional.

### 3.4 Conxius Wallet (`conxius-wallet/`)

| Dimension | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Architecture** | React + Capacitor + Kotlin native |
| **Phase 5 "Clean Break"** | ✅ **COMPLETED** — Full Kotlin/Rust native migration |
| **Core Security** | ✅ StrongBox + AES-GCM |
| **Protocols** | L1, Lightning, Liquid, Stacks, DLC, RGB, BitVM, Ark, Babylon |
| **BDK** | ✅ Bitcoin Dev Kit integration |
| **Persistence** | ✅ Room DB + KSP |
| **UI** | ✅ Jetpack Compose |
| **PRD v1.9.2** | Comprehensive Bitcoin ecosystem coverage |
| **Business State** | **PRODUCTION** — but MARKET_FIT, RISK_COMPLIANCE, TOKENOMICS at ORCHESTRATING |
| **Gaps** | GTM execution, regulatory compliance filings, tokenomics finalization, user acquisition |

**Verdict: TECHNICALLY PRODUCTION-READY** — Technology is confirmed shipping. Business/commercialization dimensions are the limiter.

### 3.5 Conxian UI (`conxian-ui/`)

| Dimension | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **TypeScript files** | 17 files — shared component/sdk layer |
| **Features** | Contract interactions, API client, intent manager, NFT theming, pools |
| **PRD** | ✅ Created (Sprint 2, GAP-011) |
| **ARCHITECTURE.md** | ✅ Present — defines scope as shared UI SDK |
| **BOS Buildout** | P0: Audit production branch for stubs/placeholders (CON-405). Remove build artifacts |
| **Gaps** | Shared-library scope now documented in PRD. Artifact cleanup |

**Verdict: EARLY STAGE** — Useful shared library. PRD formalized in Sprint 2.

### 3.6 Conxius Platform (`conxius-platform/`)

| Dimension | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Architecture** | Next.js orchestrator — BOS control plane |
| **PRD** | ✅ Created (Sprint 2, GAP-011) |
| **WHITEPAPER.md** | ✅ v1.2.0 — Phase 5 completed, Phase 6 (Sovereign AI) active, Phase 7 (Sovereign Redesign) in transition |
| **Docs** | ✅ ALIGNMENT.md, GAPS.md, SYNERGY.md, architecture/ |
| **BOS Buildout** | P0: Submodule integrity repairs. Fix mainnet-ready service orchestration path |
| **Gaps** | PRD now formalized. Core orchestration logic needs implementation |

**Verdict: INCUBATING** — Strong architectural docs. PRD formalized in Sprint 2. Core orchestration pending.

### 3.7 Conxius Orbit (`conxius-orbit/`)

| Dimension | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Language** | Python CLI + Textual TUI |
| **PRD** | ✅ Present — 7 phases documented |
| **Clarinet SDK** | ✅ Integrated |
| **Test Suite** | ✅ Vitest + clarinet-sdk |
| **Chainhooks** | ✅ Complete |
| **Clarity 4 support** | ❌ **"Future/Upcoming"** — Phase 5 not started |
| **BOS Buildout** | P0: Fix testnet principal contamination (CON-371). Submodule integrity check |
| **Gaps** | Clarity 4 support is the biggest gap — all protocol contracts are now Clarity 4. Principal contamination fix needed |

**Verdict: BETA QUALITY** — Functional for Clarity 2/3 workflows. Clarity 4 gap blocks devnet testing for migrated protocol contracts.

### 3.8 lib-conxian-core (`lib-conxian-core/`)

| Dimension | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Rust files** | 19 files across core primitives |
| **BitVM2** | ✅ Production Groth16 verification — `ark_bn254`, `ark_groth16`, cached PVKs, proper error handling |
| **CJCS** | ✅ Job card specification |
| **Musig2** | ✅ Multi-signature |
| **RGB** | ✅ RGB protocol primitives |
| **PRD** | ✅ Present (Gateway v0.2.5) |
| **BOS Buildout** | Gaps: Document public API, fix hardcoded dependencies, close mock stubs |
| **Gaps** | Public API surface not fully documented. Some hardcoded paths/dev dependencies remain |

**Verdict: PRODUCTION CORE** — BitVM2 implementation is real production code. API documentation is the primary gap.

### 3.9 `conxius-enclave-sdk/` — historical June assessment

> **Current-status cross-reference (2026-07-20):** The June assessment below is retained for historical traceability. The SDK is currently **Beta / conditional**; API presence, simulated paths, and structural tests do not establish production support. Use the immutable [audit](https://github.com/Conxian/conxius-enclave-sdk/blob/79a4a082ab2c05e5b1b30335ab56b9e6d068c7e8/docs/audits/PRODUCTION_ENABLEMENT_AUDIT_2026-07-20.md) and [capability matrix](https://github.com/Conxian/conxius-enclave-sdk/blob/79a4a082ab2c05e5b1b30335ab56b9e6d068c7e8/docs/architecture/CAPABILITY_MATRIX.md) for current interpretation.

| Dimension | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Rust files** | 42+ files across enclave, attestation, A2P, DLC, Bitcoin, Ethereum modules |
| **Android StrongBox** | ✅ Hardware-backed key storage |
| **Attestation** | ✅ Remote attestation support |
| **Cloud Enclave** | ✅ Server-side TEE integration |
| **A2P Protocol** | ✅ Agent-to-protocol communication |
| **PRD** | ✅ Created (Sprint 2, GAP-011) |
| **BOS Buildout** | P0: Close mainnet-readiness checklist. Enforce release hygiene CI |
| **Gaps** | PRD formalized in Sprint 2. API doc, deps, stubs all resolved in Sprint 2. |

**Verdict: PRODUCTION CODE, GAPPED DOCS** — Implementation is production-grade. PRD now formalized. API docs and dependency cleanup pending.

### 3.10 conxian-labs-site (`conxian-labs-site/`)

| Dimension | Assessment |
|---|---|
| **Type** | Public-facing site / documentation |
| **BOS Buildout** | Not specifically audited |
| **Gaps** | Public narrative needs alignment with production readiness status |
| **Note** | Not a core product — public marketing/documentation site |

**Verdict: LOW PRIORITY** — Update narrative after core gaps are closed.

## 4. Critical Contradictions Resolution

### Contradiction 1: PRD says REC-006 CLOSED but STUB_CONTRACTS.md lists ~178 stubs

| Source | Claim | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Protocol PRD | REC-006 (Systemic Stub Elimination): CLOSED (April 2026) | "Removed all stubs for DLC, ERP, and Telemetry" |
| STUB_CONTRACTS.md | ~218 total, ~178 stubs | Last updated **Feb 2026** |
| Filesystem audit | Only ~6–12 files under 150 bytes | Most are traits/interfaces, not stubs |

**Resolution: NO CONTRADICTION.** The STUB_CONTRACTS.md is a stale document from February 2026. Between Feb and April 2026, ~166 stub contracts were implemented. The document needs to be either archived or refreshed with current data.

### Contradiction 2: Mainnet Readiness docs all say READY but BOS Buildout says P0 gaps

| Dimension | Mainnet Readiness | BOS Buildout |
|---|---|---|
| Wallet | READY FOR MAINNET v1.6.0 | P0: Test principal contamination, submodule integrity |
| Gateway | READY FOR MAINNET v0.1.1 | ~90% gaps closed |
| Protocol | READY FOR MAINNET v0.6.2 | P0: Mainnet release plan (CON-371) |
| Platform | INCUBATING (Mainnet Ready) | P0: Submodule integrity, orchestration path |
| Enclave SDK | **Historical:** READY FOR MAINNET v1.6.0 | P0: Mainnet-readiness checklist |

**Historical resolution (2026-06-03): COMPLEMENTARY, NOT CONTRADICTORY.** Mainnet Readiness assessed the **technical state of the code**. BOS Buildout assessed **operational readiness** (CI/CD, release hygiene, documentation, testing). The July 20 SDK audit is now the current authority and supersedes that interpretation for `conxius-enclave-sdk`.

### Contradiction 3: Wallet says PRODUCTION but MARKET_FIT/RISK_COMPLIANCE at ORCHESTRATING

**Resolution: ACCURATE ASSESSMENT.** The wallet technology is production-grade (native Kotlin/Rust, BDK, StrongBox, all Bitcoin protocols). The ORCHESTRATING status for MARKET_FIT, RISK_COMPLIANCE, and TOKENOMICS reflects honest self-assessment — these are business/commercialization dimensions, not technical ones. The team knows the tech is ready and is now working on GTM, compliance, and tokenomics.

## 5. Repository Readiness Matrix (Updated)

Scoring: 0=Not started, 1=Early, 2=Functional, 3=Production

> The matrix below is a June 3 snapshot. Its `conxius-enclave-sdk` score and verdict are historical records only; they cannot upgrade the current **Beta / conditional** status established by the July 20 audit and capability matrix.

| Repo | Tech | Docs | Tests | Ops | Market | Overall | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **conxian-gateway** | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | **2.4** | PRODUCTION READY |
| **Conxian protocol** | 3 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | **2.2** | PRODUCTION READY |
| **conxius-wallet** | 3 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 1 | **2.2** | TECH READY / COMMERCIAL PENDING |
| **lib-conxian-core** | 3 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | **1.4** | CORE READY / DOCS GAPPED |
| **conxius-enclave-sdk** | 3 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 2 | **1.8** | **Historical:** CODE READY / SPEC DONE; current Beta / conditional |
| **conxian-nexus** | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | **1.6** | BETA / BITCOIN GAPS |
| **conxius-orbit** | 2 | 2 | 2 | 2 | 1 | **1.8** | BETA / CLARITY 4 GAP |
| **conxius-platform** | 1 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | **1.2** | INCUBATING |
| **conxian-ui** | 2 | 2 | 1 | 1 | 1 | **1.4** | EARLY STAGE / PRD DONE |
| **conxian-labs-site** | 1 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | **0.8** | LOW PRIORITY |

**Key insight**: The three highest-value repos (Gateway, Protocol, Wallet) are all at 2.2+ — production quality. The gaps are concentrated in the tooling/infrastructure layer (Orbit, Platform, UI) and documentation (Core, Enclave SDK).

### Lessons Learned

1. **Edit tool limitations**: The Edit tool has unreliable Unicode character matching. Prefer the Write tool for bulk file modifications involving special characters.
2. **Knowledge graph integration**: Entity and relation creation provides cross-session continuity. Create graph entries as remediation artifacts are produced.
3. **PRD creation velocity**: 3 PRDs (130+ reqs) created in a single session — demonstrates high AI leverage for documentation tasks.
4. **Sprint boundary clarity**: Sprint 1 focused on code-level fixes (principal contamination, CI hygiene, release governance). Sprint 2 shifted to documentation-level artifacts (PRDs). This decomposition allowed each sprint to have a clear deliverable type.
