# CON-137: Community funding model for system delivery

This document is the policy artifact for https://linear.app/conxian-labs/issue/CON-137/community-funding-model-for-system-delivery.

It defines which work can be community-funded, which work must remain internal-only, and how to size bounties in a consistent, reviewable way.

## Definitions

- **Community-contributable**: work that external contributors may submit via PR, but payout is not implied.
- **Community-funded**: work that is explicitly funded and payable via **ConxianCSF**, where the sole source of bounty funds is the **ALEX launch path**.

Until ConxianCSF is verifiably deployed and ALEX launch-path funding is enabled, treat all external contributions as community-contributable only.

## Funding constraints (normative)

1. Do not advertise an issue as a paid bounty unless it is ConxianCSF-backed and ALEX-funded.
   - Concretely: do not claim/label it as funded, do not publish payout amounts, and do not mark it as `Bounty Open` unless the ConxianCSF/ALEX gates are met.
   - Eligibility classification (community-contributable vs internal-only) is allowed and is not a payout promise.
2. Maintainers MUST NOT request, confirm, or act on payout instructions (addresses, payment rails, etc.) in issue threads.
3. Payout-enabling controls remain maintainer-only (see `MAINTAINER_PAYOUT_ENABLEMENT_RUNBOOK.md`).

## Eligibility: which work can be community-funded

An issue may be eligible for community funding only if all of the following are true:

1. It has PR-shaped acceptance criteria that can be validated from the repo (tests/docs/screenshots) without privileged access.
2. It requires no secrets, privileged deployment access, signer/key handling, or treasury/principal changes.
3. It is not classified as internal-only, security-sensitive, or payout-gated.

Examples of commonly eligible categories:

- Docs/specs/diagrams that do not disclose sensitive ops.
- UI/UX and SDK ergonomics that do not touch wallet/signer/security-critical flows.
- “Data-shape only” adapters (encoders/decoders, schema mapping, validation) with deterministic tests.
- Reproducible bug fixes in non-sensitive areas.

## Internal-only: which work must never be community-funded

The following categories remain internal-only even if they are “code work”:

- Deployment, release gating, and mainnet cutover runbooks.
- Wallet/signer/key material or any signing flows.
- Treasury, operational principal management, payout controls, and payout enablement.
- Security-sensitive work (authn/authz, permissions, coordinated disclosure fixes).
- Operational configuration or anything that would require disclosing “how production is run.”

If an issue is covered by `CON-231_BOUNTY_CLASSIFICATION_2026-04-12.md`, that classification is the source of truth for whether it can be treated as externally claimable.

## Claim discipline (anti-parking)

To prevent “parking” an issue with no progress:

1. The canonical claim intent is `/claim` on the synced GitHub issue (when available).
2. If GitHub claim automation is not available, a claim is only valid when a maintainer assigns the issue and moves it to `Claimed`.
3. Within **48 hours** of assignment, the assignee must open a draft PR (or an equivalent concrete artifact). If not, unassign and move the issue back to `Todo`.

## Bounty sizing rubric (Bounty Points)

Size bounties off **reviewable delivery**, not hours spent.

### Step 0 — eligibility gate

If the issue fails eligibility (see above), it is not community-funded and should not be sized.

### Step 1 — base size

Pick the smallest base size that matches the acceptance criteria.

| Size | Base BP | Typical “done” shape |
|---|---:|---|
| S | 5 | Small doc/spec change or isolated fix; low review load |
| M | 10 | Feature slice or adapter module; tests included |
| L | 20 | Multi-module but still reviewable; integration tests or end-to-end local sim |
| XL | 40 | Decomposition signal; do not publish as one bounty (split into multiple M/L issues) |

BP = “Bounty Points” (token-agnostic).

### Step 2 — multipliers

Apply multipliers for review cost and priority (round to nearest 5 BP).

**Review/Risk multiplier (R)** (review complexity; not “security-sensitive” work)

- Low = 1.0
- Medium = 1.25
- High = 1.5

**Impact/Priority multiplier (P)**

- Nice-to-have = 0.75
- Unblocks internal deliverable = 1.0
- Critical unblocker = 1.25

**Formula**

`TotalBP = BaseBP * R * P` (round to nearest 5)

### Step 3 — limits

- Do not publish single issues larger than `L`.
- Treat any sizing that lands above **40 BP** as `XL` and split the work into multiple S/M/L issues before marking them community-funded. The `XL` row in the table is a smell indicator, not an allowed base size for a single bounty.

## ConxianCSF mapping (post-ALEX)

Once ConxianCSF is live and ALEX funding is the active bounty source of funds, store the bounty entry with:

- `issue_url` (Linear + GitHub/PR links when applicable)
- `total_bp`
- `max_payout` (derived from a governance-set conversion rate)
- `expiry` (explicit timebox)
- `acceptance_criteria_ref`
- `maintainer_reviewer`
