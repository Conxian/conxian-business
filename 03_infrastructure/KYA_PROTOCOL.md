# Know Your Agent (KYA) Protocol: Standardizing Machine-to-Machine Trust

## 1. Executive Summary
In the 2026 financial landscape, capital is increasingly managed by autonomous AI agents. The **Know Your Agent (KYA)** protocol provides a hardware-secured framework for verifying the identity, intent, and risk parameters of autonomous entities interacting with the Conxian Sovereign Autonomous Business (SAB) framework.

## 2. The Identity Tier: Enclave-Attested Agent IDs
Unlike human KYC, which relies on government-issued documents, KYA relies on **Hardware Attestation**.
- **Agent Root of Trust:** Every agent operating within the Conxian ecosystem must be anchored to a TEE/StrongBox key.
- **Verification:** The agent's public key is tied to a cryptographically signed manifest detailing its model version, owner, and operational bounds.

## 3. Operational Bounds (The "Guardrails")
KYA enforces "Programmatic Discretion" through the SAB Manager model:
- **Balance Limits:** Maximum capital an agent can deploy without human quorum.
- **Protocol Whitelisting:** Restriction to specific Stacks/Bitcoin L2 smart contracts.
- **Temporal Constraints:** Specific windows of operation (e.g., only during specific burn-block heights).

## 4. Machine-to-Machine Settlement
The Conxian Gateway acts as the KYA Registrar. When Agent A (an AI liquidity bot) interacts with Agent B (an SAB Treasury), the Gateway verifies:
1.  **Attestation:** Is the agent running in a secure enclave?
2.  **Reputation:** Historical compliance with SAB guardrails.
3.  **Liquidity Proof:** Cryptographic proof of control over the required UTXOs or sBTC.

## 5. Strategic Network Effect
By standardizing KYA, Conxian becomes the default routing and settlement layer for "Agentic Finance." As more autonomous capital enters the market, the network effect of a unified, hardware-secured trust layer creates an insurmountable moat against unverified, retail-grade systems.
