# Process Power: Multichain Routing via Wormhole Native Token Transfers (NTT)

## 1. Executive Summary
To enhance "Process Power," Conxian embeds Wormhole's **Native Token Transfers (NTT)** framework directly into the SAB's automated settlement logic. NTT allows assets (like CXD or sBTC) to move across blockchains (Solana, Stacks, Bitcoin L1) without the risks associated with wrapped assets or liquidity fragmentation.

## 2. Native Multichain Settlement Logic
The Engine's routing logic is not a simple "bridge feature" but a complex, opaque operational process:
- **Unified Liquidity Pools:** Assets are treated as a single global supply. The SAB manages "Burn-and-Mint" across NTT-enabled chains to rebalance treasury states autonomously.
- **Cross-Chain Debt Settlement:** If an SAB Pod on Solana requires liquidity, the Stacks-based "Staff" agent initiates an NTT transfer that bypasses public DEXes, utilizing Conxian's internal transceiver network.
- **Gas Abstraction via NTT:** Users pay fees in sBTC on any chain; the NTT Transceiver handles the underlying gas conversion and multichain routing behind the scenes.

## 3. The "Opaque Complexity" Moat
Competitors cannot easily copy this process because it requires:
1.  **Enclave-to-Enclave Attestation:** Secure NTT signatures generated within "The Vault."
2.  **SAB Governance:** Multi-chain pods governed by a single, unified SAB logic.
3.  **Wormhole Deep Integration:** Native support for NTT's "Transceiver" model, which allows Conxian to define custom verification rules for cross-chain messages.

## 4. Implementation Map (2026 Phase 6)
- **Layer 1:** Stacks (Hub) - Sovereign logic and SAB management.
- **Layer 2:** Solana - High-frequency trading and retail distribution.
- **Layer 3:** Bitcoin L1 - Final settlement and long-term treasury lock-up.
- **Transceiver:** Conxian's custom NTT Transceiver verifies signatures against the "Hardware-Attested" registrar to prevent cross-chain relay attacks.

## 5. Strategic Advantage
This multichain routing creates **Process Power** by making Conxian's internal treasury operations highly efficient and inherently secure, while presenting a simplified, "Gas-less" interface to the end user.
