# Governed Automation: Hardware-Secured Institutional Standards

## 1. The Institutional Risk of Browser Extensions
In the 2026 landscape, retail-centric browser extensions (e.g., MetaMask, Xverse) are classified as "High-Risk Software" for institutional treasuries. Their vulnerability to memory injection, phishing, and OS-level keyloggers makes them structurally unsuitable for autonomous financial agents.

## 2. Standard: Hardware-Level Risk Controls (HLRC)
Conxian mandates **Hardware-Level Risk Controls** via the Android TEE/StrongBox architecture ("The Vault").
- **Isolated Execution:** Signing logic occurs in a dedicated security processor, invisible to the host Android OS.
- **Enclave-Gated Policies:** Treasury policies (e.g., "No transaction over 1 BTC without 3-of-5 quorum") are enforced *inside* the enclave, not in the app's UI layer.
- **Attested UI:** Secure PIN entry and biometric confirmation are handled by the TEE, preventing "UI Overlay" attacks.

## 3. Governed Automation vs. Retail Convenience
| Feature | Retail Extensions (Browser) | Conxian Governed Automation (TEE) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Key Storage** | Browser Local Storage (Vulnerable) | StrongBox Security Chip (Isolated) |
| **Automation Risk** | Infinite Approval (High Drain Risk) | Enclave-Gated Spent-Limits (Mitigated) |
| **Audit Trail** | App-Level Logs (Forgeable) | Hardware-Attested Proofs (Immutable) |
| **Agent Support** | Unrestricted API Access | KYA-Verified Model Attestation |

## 4. Strategic Counter-Positioning
Conxian markets "High-Friction Security" as a premium feature for **Governed Automation.** While retail wallets optimize for speed and ease of use (at the cost of security), Conxian optimizes for **Institutional Solvency.**

By making hardware-level controls a structural mandate, Conxian forces competitors into a "Dominant Strategy Trap":
- If they replicate Conxian's TEE-first approach, they destroy their core "browser convenience" user experience.
- If they don't replicate it, they remain excluded from the institutional treasury and agentic finance markets.

## 5. Compliance Alignment
These standards align with the **2026 MiCA "Secure Custody"** requirements and provide the "Mathematically Verifiable Compliance" necessary for institutional fiduciaries.
