## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Release Hygiene**: Added missing `## [Unreleased]` sections to submodule changelogs in `conxian-gateway`, `conxian-nexus`, `conxius-wallet`, `conxius-platform`, `Conxian`, and `lib-conxian-core`.
- **Render Deployment Remediation**: Fixed critical port binding issue in `conxian-ui` to resolve "Unknown --listen endpoint scheme" errors on Render.
- **Submodule Integrity Scripts**: Created `scripts/verify_submodule_integrity.py` and `scripts/verify_contamination_guard.py` to resolve daily Submodule Pin Integrity Audit workflow failures. Scripts validate submodule initialization state and scan for hardcoded testnet principals.
- **Conxian Unified Theory v2.0:** Integrated the foundational mathematical framework for sovereign enterprise into `docs/CONXIAN_UNIFIED_THEORY_v2.md`.
- **Sovereign Enterprise Mandate:** Updated `AGENTS.md` and `docs/AGENTS.md` to enforce $V_X$ and $A_S$ alignment across agentic sessions.

### Changed
- **BOS Source-of-Truth Restoration**: Restored over 40 missing canonical documents and specification stubs to `conxian-business/` and `docs/` from Git history to repair repository integrity and ensure all documentation references resolve correctly.
- **Repository Versioning**: Updated root `README.md` to reflect BOS v1.9.4 alignment.
- **System Wallet Standardization**: Aligned `SystemWallets` in `conxian-gateway` core with the canonical Sovereign Treasury principal (`SP3FBR2AGK5H9QPNVFJWC7636X22Y620S00000000`).
- **CON-702 Parent-Control Checkpoint**: Added `docs/architecture/CONXIAN_UI_PARENT_CONTROL_ALIGNMENT_PLAN.md` and aligned role/checklist/portfolio docs so `Conxian_UI` is documented as a supporting/reference consumer surface (no secrets, signing keys, or privileged broadcast authority).
- **Dependabot target branch**: Changed all 5 ecosystem update entries from `dev` to `main` to ensure security updates are applied to the production branch directly.

### Fixed
- **Testnet Principals Remediation**: Replaced hardcoded testnet principals (`ST...`) with environment-agnostic or Sovereign-aligned principals (`SP...`) in `conxius-wallet`, `conxian-ui`, and `Conxian` mainnet release plans.
- **Contamination Guard Compliance (CON-371):** Finalized remediation of hardcoded testnet principals in the `Conxian` submodule to satisfy production contamination gates.
- **DEX Logic Correction**: Resolved a result-type mismatch in the `concentrated-liquidity-pool.clar` swap-execution path.
- **Gemini Scheduled Triage**: Fixed search query from AND logic (`no:label label:"status/needs-triage"`) to OR logic (`no:label,label:"status/needs-triage"`) and added graceful fallback for empty result sets.
- **Gemini Dispatch Fallthrough**: Added `needs.dispatch.result == 'success'` guard to prevent false-positive failure comments when the dispatch job is skipped (e.g., for forked PRs).

### Security
- **Mock Pattern Enforcement**: Verified that `mock-integrations` features in `conxian-gateway` and `conxian-nexus` are strictly gated by `compile_error!` for release builds.
- **Testnet Contamination Guard**: Remediated residual testnet addresses in production-track files to prevent accidental mainnet contamination.

## [1.9.4] - 2026-05-03

### Added
- **BOS Knowledge Graph (Crystallization):** Finalized the canonical v1.9.3 entity and relationship map in `conxian-business/BOS_KNOWLEDGE_GRAPH.md`.
- **ZSE Transparency Custodian:** Enhanced `transparency_custodian.py` with cross-repository auditing and automated Zero Secret Egress (ZSE) compliance checks.

### Changed
- **Linear Issue Finalization:** Verified and closed core alignment issues (CON-614, CON-615, CON-619, CON-620, CON-624) to mark the end of the April 2026 Sprint.
- **Portfolio Mapping:** Updated `BOS_RUNTIME_OWNERSHIP_MAP.md` to provide a definitive guide for Sovereign BOS module responsibilities.

### Fixed
- **Audit Verification:** Remediated logic gaps in the transparency custodian to prevent accidental scanning of `.git` and `node_modules` while protecting sensitive patterns.

## [1.9.3] - 2026-04-26

### Added
- **Decentralized RPC Aggregation (Gateway):** Implemented resilient provider pooling and automatic failover for Stacks and Bitcoin RPC endpoints in `conxian-gateway`.
- **Sovereign Persistence Alignment (Nexus):** Standardized `KwilAdapter` and `TablelandAdapter` commitments with ISO-8601 timestamps and RFC3339 compatibility in `conxian-nexus`.
- **BOS Platformization (BaaP):** Updated `BOS_PLATFORM_SPEC.md` with multi-tenancy (Jurisdictional Sharding) and declarative provisioning (Akash SDL) standards derived from competitive research.

### Changed
- **System-Wide Version Alignment:** Aligned all core module versions and changelogs to v1.9.3 for unified mainnet readiness signaling.
- **Documentation Sanitization:** Renamed "Sovereign" surfaces to "Sovereign" in public READMEs across Gateway, Wallet, and Core SDK to improve public clarity and reduce strategic exposure.

### Fixed
- **Release Hygiene:** Remediated missing `## [Unreleased]` and versioning gaps in submodule changelogs identified by CI.
- **Repository Hygiene:** Executed portfolio-wide pruning of merged branches in root and submodules.

## [1.9.2] - 2026-04-14

### Added
- **BitVM2 Verification Bridge:** Integrated SNARK-based verification for CJCS v2.0 Job Cards in `conxian-gateway` and `lib-conxian-core`.
- **Sovereign Hook Standard:** Defined the standard for "Sovereign Hooks" in `conxian-business/BOS_PLATFORM_SPEC.md` to align with SAP Clean Core patterns.

### Changed
- **BOS Governance Baseline:** Hardened the repository governance model in `GOVERNANCE.md` and `CODEOWNERS` to meet Phase 5 production mandates.
