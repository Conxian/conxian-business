# Business Development Repository Audit & Monetization Gap Analysis
**Date:** March 1, 2026
**Objective:** Identify technical gaps across the Conxian ecosystem that prevent the immediate execution of the new B2B/B2C dynamic pricing models, and convert them into actionable engineering tickets.

## 1. `lib-conclave-sdk` (The B2B Cash Cow)
**Business Goal:** Monetize the headless StrongBox SDK via a $2,500/mo flat fee or a 50k signature API limit.
**Current State:** The SDK is purely mathematical. It runs locally and generates keys/signatures perfectly via Rust/JNI, but it is currently a "dumb" client. 
**Monetization Gaps:**
*   **Missing Telemetry:** There is no mechanism to track how many signatures a B2B dApp is making. We cannot enforce the "50k free limit" if we don't know the volume.
*   **Missing API Key Auth:** The SDK needs to require an initialization API Key tied to a Conxian developer account.

**Actionable Tickets:**
1.  **[SDK-01] Implement API Key Initialization:** Require `Conclave.init(apiKey)` before allowing `sign()`.
2.  **[SDK-02] Build Asynchronous Telemetry Ping:** Add a non-blocking background thread in the Rust core that sends a lightweight ping to `conxian-nexus` every time a signature is successfully generated, allowing the backend to increment the client's billing counter.

## 2. `conxian-nexus` (The Gateway Billing Engine)
**Business Goal:** Track SDK usage, enforce SaaS paywalls (Stripe/Crypto), and execute dynamic PPP arbitrage.
**Current State:** Nexus acts as an MEV/liquidator bot and syncs Stacks state. It does not currently handle user authentication or SaaS billing logic.
**Monetization Gaps:**
*   **No Developer Console API:** We need backend routes to generate SDK API keys and track their usage.
*   **No Stripe / Web3 Payment Integration:** We cannot physically charge the $1.00 PPP or $9.99 Pro fees.

**Actionable Tickets:**
1.  **[NEXUS-01] Developer API Key Generation & Verification Engine:** Create Redis-backed API routes for issuing and verifying SDK keys with extremely low latency.
2.  **[NEXUS-02] Signature Telemetry Ingestion Endpoint:** Create a high-throughput `/telemetry/track-signature` route to count B2B SDK usage.
3.  **[NEXUS-03] Stripe / Stables Billing Integration:** Implement Stripe webhooks for the $9.99/mo fiat tier and a smart contract listener for stablecoin subscription payments.

## 3. `conxius-wallet` (The Retail Flywheel)
**Business Goal:** Extract the 0.1% Sovereignty-Adjusted Fee (SAF) on routing and push power users into the $9.99/mo Pro tier.
**Current State:** UI is built and StrongBox is integrated, but all routing is assumed free. There is no paywall UI blocking Tor or Musig2.
**Monetization Gaps:**
*   **Missing SAF Routing Fee:** The swap UI does not automatically subtract 0.1% to a Conxian treasury address.
*   **Missing Paywall Gates:** The UI allows access to all features regardless of account state.

**Actionable Tickets:**
1.  **[WALLET-01] Implement the 0.1% SAF Routing Tax:** When constructing swap payloads (e.g., via Boltz or DEX), dynamically inject an output routing 0.1% of the volume to the `Conxian Operational Treasury`.
2.  **[WALLET-02] Build the "Conclave Pro" Paywall UI:** Gate the Tor Network settings and Musig2 vault creation behind a "Subscribe to Pro" modal that pings `conxian-nexus` for payment verification.

## 4. `Conxian` (DeFi Smart Contracts)
**Business Goal:** Extract protocol origination fees and liquidation penalties directly into the DAO Treasury.
**Current State:** `swap-router.clar` has a static `BASE-FEE u30` (0.3%). `fee-manager.clar` exists but is disconnected from the dynamic PPP oracle data.
**Monetization Gaps:**
*   **Static Fees:** We are not utilizing the cybernetic/dynamic fee logic. If we want to undercut MetaMask, the Stacks contracts need to be able to accept dynamic fee parameters based on the user's tier.
*   **Treasury Accumulation:** The contracts need strict functions to sweep accumulated fees to the `operational-treasury.clar`.

**Actionable Tickets:**
1.  **[DEFI-01] Connect Oracle Stub to Fee Manager:** Allow the `conxian-nexus` PPP Oracle to dynamically adjust base swap fees down to 0.1% for high-volume or Pro users.
2.  **[DEFI-02] Implement `sweep-fees` Functionality:** Ensure the `swap-router` and `lending-manager` have public functions that allow Nexus to batch transfer accrued Protocol Origination Fees into the operational treasury.
