# Conclave SDK: The Institutional Citadel

**Secure Your L2. Own Your Sovereignty.**

## The Problem with Current Embedded Wallets (Privy, Web3Auth, Turnkey)

1. **Vendor Lock-in:** You are reliant on their centralized MPC networks or server-side enclaves. If they go down, or change pricing, your users lose access.
2. **Trust Assumption:** You must trust the SaaS provider's operational security.
3. **High Latency:** Network round-trips to sign transactions degrade the user experience.

## The Conclave SDK Solution (Mathematical Supremacy)

Conclave SDK is a **headless cryptographic state machine** that commoditizes the user's *own* mobile hardware.

1. **Zero Vendor Lock-in (Self-Custody):** Keys are generated and stored exclusively in the Android StrongBox or Apple Secure Enclave natively on the user's device.
2. **Nakamoto-Native Finality:** Because the SDK is completely open-source and stateless, it anchors directly to the Bitcoin burn chain without Conxian middleware interference.
3. **Ultra-Low Latency (300ms):** Because signing happens directly on the native hardware (TEE), there are zero network bottlenecks for transaction signing.

## Why Emerging Bitcoin L2s Choose Conclave

* **Institutional Multi-Sig (Musig2):** Out-of-the-box support for Taproot Musig2 quorums, allowing distributed, hardware-backed corporate treasuries.
* **Sovereign Rails (M12):** Bypass public API censorship. Route swaps and bridges through dedicated, private proxies.
* **Open & Permissionless:** Built on the "Code is Law" ethos.

## Transparent, Ethos-Aligned Pricing

* **Conclave Free Tier:** Up to 50,000 signatures per month completely free to build and test. 
* **Conclave Starter (PPP Scaled):** Once past the free tier, pricing scales from **$1.00/mo upwards**, adjusted dynamically for Purchasing Power Parity (PPP) in emerging markets. No fiat credit walls—pay in stables.
* **Institutional Tier ($2.5k - $15k/mo):** Dedicated sovereign routing, priority Musig2 integration, and full SLA support.

**Stop renting security. Start owning your citadel.**
