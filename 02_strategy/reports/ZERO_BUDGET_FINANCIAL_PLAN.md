# Zero-to-One Financial Plan: Bootstrap & COGS Minimization

## 1. Context: The Zero-Budget Reality
Conxian Labs is currently operating at **Phase 5 (Level 3: Sovereign Scaling)** with a starting runway of **$0**. To survive and reach profitability without initial venture capital, the business must employ a **Ruthless COGS (Cost of Goods Sold) Minimization Strategy** alongside immediate, low-friction revenue generation from both B2C and B2B markets.

## 2. COGS Minimization Strategy (The $0 OpEx Model)
Every piece of infrastructure has been architected to push costs away from centralized servers and onto decentralized or free-tier resources.

### 2.1 Compute & Hosting (Cloud Free Tiers)
*   **Web Interfaces (`conxian-ui`, `conxian-labs-site`):** Deployed on **Vercel/Netlify Free Tiers**. Next.js edge caching ensures high performance with zero hosting costs.
*   **Gateway & Nexus (`conxian-gateway`, `conxian-nexus`):** Deployed via **GCP Cloud Run (Serverless)**. The free tier provides 2 million requests per month. Rust's extreme memory efficiency ensures the gateway never exceeds the free tier memory limits.
*   **Database:** Use **Supabase Free Tier** (500MB database, 2GB bandwidth) for Nexus state tracking, or rely entirely on local SQLite/Redis during the MVP phase.

### 2.2 Security Operations (Client-Side Compute)
*   **Zero HSM Costs:** Traditional financial apps pay heavily for cloud HSMs (Hardware Security Modules). Conxian pushes this cost to the user by leveraging the **Android TEE / StrongBox** natively on their own mobile devices.
*   **Automated CI/CD:** All synergy testing, security linting, and PR checks run on **GitHub Actions (Free for public repositories)**.

### 2.3 Blockchain Infrastructure (Public to Sovereign Pivot)
*   **Initial Phase (Now):** Rely exclusively on free public RPCs (Hiro for Stacks, Mempool.space for Bitcoin, public Electrum nodes) to avoid node-hosting costs.
*   **Growth Phase (Post-Revenue):** Only spin up dedicated sovereign proxies (M12) once B2B or B2C revenue covers the server costs.

## 3. Immediate Revenue Generation (Path to Profitability)
With zero marketing budget, revenue must be generated organically through viral retail adoption and institutional presales.

### 3.1 B2C Viral Growth & Retail Revenue (The Sovereign Flywheel)
The retail wallet (`conxius-wallet`) is the top-of-funnel acquisition channel.
*   **Conclave Pro Subscriptions ($9.99/mo):** Gate advanced power-user features (Multi-sig orchestration, unlimited Tor routing, zero base-fee swaps) behind a standard SaaS subscription. 1,000 power users = ~$10k/MRR, completely covering initial scale-out infrastructure.
*   **Swap Spreads (SAF Floor):** The "Sovereignty-Adjusted Fee" guarantees a minimum 0.1% spread on all cross-chain and L2 swaps routed through our app via Boltz or Changelly. No capital inventory is required; we merely act as the secure router.
*   **Hardware Wallet Affiliates (Zero-Cost Setup):** Integrate Trezor, BitBox, and Ledger affiliate links directly into the wallet UI for users wanting cold-storage backups. This provides a passive 10-15% commission per sale with zero integration risk.
*   **"Sovereign Lock-in":** The more a user utilizes our infrastructure (high Sovereignty Score), the lower their fees. This creates viral retention as users mathematically realize it is cheaper and safer to stay in the Conxian ecosystem.

### 3.2 B2B "Conclave SDK" Presales
*   **Action:** Package the existing TEE/StrongBox code into a white-label SDK.
*   **Revenue:** Approach emerging Bitcoin L2s (who urgently need secure mobile interfaces) for **Letters of Intent (LOIs)** or paid pilot programs ($2.5k/mo). A single B2B contract immediately funds all infrastructure for a year.

## 4. Runway Milestones
1.  **Month 1-3:** $0 OpEx. Rely strictly on Free Tiers and GitHub Actions. Focus on launching the B2C Wallet Beta, capturing early "Conclave Pro" users, and pitching the B2B SDK.
2.  **First Revenue (B2C or B2B):** Converts runway from $0 to infinite (based on current micro-OpEx).
3.  **Scaling OpEx:** Once free tiers are exceeded, use incoming SAF revenue, Pro subscriptions, and B2B licensing to fund the transition to dedicated AWS/GCP nodes (executing M12).

## 5. Conclusion
By leveraging Rust's efficiency, serverless free tiers, and pushing cryptographic compute to the user's mobile hardware, Conxian Labs can maintain a functional, high-security ecosystem at **effectively zero cost**. The dual-pronged approach of viral B2C utility fees and high-margin B2B licensing guarantees a path to profitability without external venture reliance.
