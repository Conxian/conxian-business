# Conxian Labs: 5-Year Strategic Plan (2026 Update)

## Executive Summary
Conxian Labs is building the sovereign financial infrastructure for the Bitcoin Renaissance. Our 5-year plan transitions from high-utility retail tools to institutional-grade orchestration and settlement.

## Timeline Overview
- **Year 1-2 (2025-2026)**: Foundation & Product-Market Fit.
  - Deployment of **Conxius Wallet** (TEE-secured).
  - Launch of **Conxian Finance** (Nakamoto-native smart contracts).
  - .5M Pre-seed focus.
- **Year 2-3 (2026-2027)**: Scaling Operations & Market Expansion.
  - Global Liquidity Mesh mainnet deployment.
  - Institutional SDK (Conclave) launch.
  - 5M Seed focus.
- **Year 3-4 (2027-2028)**: Series A & Infrastructure Hardening.
  - Progressive Decentralization: Transitioning from cloud-only to hybrid/sovereign infrastructure.
  - 0M target.
- **Year 5+ (2029+)**: Global Dominance & Series C.
  - Full Bitcoin Network Integration (BitVM, RGB, Taproot).
  - 00M+ target.

## Strategic Pillars
### 1. Technical Sovereignty (The Conclave)
We prioritize hardware-grade security (TEE/StrongBox) and "Code is Law" logic (Clarity/Rust).

### 2. Regulatory Alignment (The Shield)
We operate a strictly non-custodial model. Regulated actions are delegated to authorized partners (Transak, VALR).

### 3. Institutional Utility (The Gateway)
Providing SLA-grade APIs and SDKs for fintechs and neobanks to access the Bitcoin economy.

## Infrastructure Strategy
- **Years 0-3.5**: Cloud-only infrastructure (GCP/Render) to maintain agility.
- **Year 3.5+**: Transition to sovereign node networks and decentralized hosting where feasible.

## Scaling Triggers
- Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) milestones.
- Total Value Locked (TVL) growth on-chain.
- System health and performance metrics (Glass Node telemetry).
