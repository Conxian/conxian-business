# Gap Analysis: Conxian Labs 7 Powers Evaluation (2026 Alignment)

## 1. Network Economies (Sovereign Autonomous Business & Agentic Finance)
*   **Current State:** SAB is defined as a "digital corporation" replacing human discretion with math. Focus is on internal operations (Manager/Staff model).
*   **Gap:** Lacks explicit positioning for "Agentic Finance" where AI agents are the primary users. No "Know Your Agent" (KYA) protocol definition for machine-to-machine trust.
*   **7 Powers Alignment:** Missing the viral network effect of AI-driven capital flows utilizing the SAB framework as a default settlement layer.

## 2. Switching Costs (The Engine & Enterprise ERP)
*   **Current State:** "The Engine" handles automated settlement on-chain. Documentation mentions B2B but lacks specific ERP integration paths.
*   **Gap:** No native synchronization models for syncing Bitcoin L2 yields with legacy accounting (SAP/Oracle/NetSuite). Missing the "Office of the CFO" narrative.
*   **7 Powers Alignment:** Low organizational lock-in if the system doesn't directly automate month-end closes and journal entries in the enterprise's primary record system.

## 3. Counter-Positioning (The Vault vs. Browser Extensions)
*   **Current State:** Technical documentation for Android TEE/StrongBox is robust. Strategic positioning focuses on "Sovereignty."
*   **Gap:** Not marketed as "Governed Automation." Fails to highlight why retail-centric browser extensions are structurally incapable of meeting 2026 institutional risk standards.
*   **7 Powers Alignment:** Competitors can currently claim "security" without being forced into a high-friction hardware mandate that protects institutional treasuries.

## 4. Process Power (Wormhole NTT Multichain Routing)
*   **Current State:** NTT bridge is implemented as a feature for token transfers.
*   **Gap:** Not utilized as a source of "Process Power." Routing logic is transparent and feature-based rather than embedded as an opaque, complex operational advantage.
*   **7 Powers Alignment:** COMPETITORS can copy a "bridge feature" easily; they cannot copy a "native multichain settlement logic" embedded in complex business workflows.

## 5. Branding (The Regulatory Trust Moat)
*   **Current State:** Positioning is "Non-Custodial." Compliance docs are high-level.
*   **Gap:** No specific alignment with 2026 MiCA or IRS Form 1099-DA rules within the Enclave's verification logic. Lacks "Mathematically Verifiable Compliance Reports" (MVCR).
*   **7 Powers Alignment:** Branding as "Legal Registry" is weak without hardware-level audit trails that are inherently regulatory-compliant.
