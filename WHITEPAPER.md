# Conxian: The Bitcoin Sovereign Finance Layer
**Whitepaper v1.2.0 (2026 Revision - Phase 5 Alignment)**

## Abstract
Conxian is a comprehensive DeFi orchestration platform designed to make Bitcoin a productive asset. By integrating Stacks L2 (Nakamoto) smart contracts with a high-performance middleware layer (Conxian Gateway & Nexus), Conxian provides institutional-grade access to sovereign Bitcoin services.

## 1. Vision & Ethos
### 1.1 Full Bitcoin Network Orientation
All system states are anchored to Bitcoin burn-block-height. Bitcoin is the ultimate settlement layer and source of truth.

### 1.2 Earthy Corporate Finance
Design language conveying trust, stability, and professional financial orchestration.

## 2. Technical Architecture
### 2.1 Conxian Gateway (The Orchestrator)
High-performance Fusion gateway (Rust/Actix-web) orchestrating cross-chain atomic swaps (Stacks, Liquid, Rootstock) and providing tiered institutional access.
### 2.2 Conxian Nexus (The Glass Node)
Functions as a **Decentralized Risk Oracle** and API bridge. Provides verifiable state proofs and cryptographically signed risk scoring.
### 2.3 Conxius Wallet (The Vault)
Mobile secure enclave integration for local intent signing, providing hardware-level security (TEE/StrongBox).

## 3. Core Features
### 3.1 Global Liquidity Mesh
Active orchestration of HTLC-based atomic swaps ensuring seamless sovereign asset mobility.
### 3.2 Governed Automation
Switching cost strategy via deterministic synchronization between on-chain yields and legacy enterprise ERP systems (SAP, Oracle, NetSuite).
