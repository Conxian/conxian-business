# Core Values

1. **Code is Law**: Mathematical certainty over human discretion.
2. **Logic is Sovereign**: System states are governed by verifiable logic.
3. **Bitcoin-Anchored Sovereignty**: All fundamental states are tied to the Bitcoin blockchain.
4. **Non-Custodial by Design**: Users maintain absolute control over their keys via TEE/StrongBox.
5. **Transparency**: All telemetry and system logic are verifiable (Glass Node Architecture).
