# Contributing to Conxian

Welcome to the Conxian ecosystem. We are building a Bitcoin-native Business Operations System (BOS).

## Getting Started

1.  Review the [OpenSpec](./openspec/) directory for technical specifications.
2.  Explore the [Nomenclature Alignment](./audit/nomenclature-alignment.md) for branding and naming standards.
3.  Check the [Sovereign-Ops-Orchestrator](./Sovereign-Ops-Orchestrator) for open bounties.

## Pull Request Process

1.  Ensure all code changes map to an existing Linear issue.
2.  Maintain Zero Secret Egress (ZSE) compliance.
3.  All Clarity smart contracts must pass the Vitest/Simnet test suite.
4.  Documentation must be updated to match implementation.
5.  Review the [**CODEOWNERS**](./CODEOWNERS) file to identify the appropriate reviewers for your changes.
6.  Ensure any changes are reflected in the [**CHANGELOG.md**](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Security Issues

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, do not open a public issue or pull request.

Follow the reporting guidance in [**SECURITY.md**](./SECURITY.md).

## Releases and Versioning

This repository follows Semantic Versioning and documents notable changes in [**CHANGELOG.md**](./CHANGELOG.md).

If your change affects a user-facing behavior or a security posture, include a changelog entry in the appropriate version section.

## Coding Standards

- **Rust**: Use standard `rustfmt` and `clippy`.
- **Clarity**: Use the 'cxn-' prefix for all contract components.
- **UI**: Use the centralized component library in `conxian-ui`.

## Governance

Conxian operates as a Sovereign Autonomous Business. Contributions are validated by the EXCO agent suite and must adhere to the [**LICENSE**](./LICENSE) terms.
