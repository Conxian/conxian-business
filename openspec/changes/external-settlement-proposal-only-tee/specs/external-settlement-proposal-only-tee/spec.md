# Spec: Proposal-only external settlement triggers (TEE enforced)

Proposal-only external settlement triggers define how ISO 20022 / PAPSS / BRICS messages may enter the sovereign system.

## 1. Normative rules

1. **TradFi payloads are never execution authority**
   - A raw ISO 20022 / PAPSS / BRICS payload MUST NOT be consumed by any execution function.
   - Raw payloads MAY be parsed/normalized for audit and mapping.

2. **TEE verification is required before proposal emission**
   - A proposal MUST NOT be emitted unless a TEE/StrongBox/CloudTEE attestation verifies:
     - `raw_payload_hash` MUST equal the lowercase hex encoding (no `0x` prefix) of the 32-byte SHA-256 digest of `raw_payload_bytes` (computed from `raw_payload_bytes` inside the TEE),
     - `normalized_settlement_hash` MUST equal the lowercase hex encoding (no `0x` prefix) of the 32-byte SHA-256 digest of `canonical_settlement_tx_bytes`, where `canonical_settlement_tx_bytes` is the rail-specific canonical serialization of the normalized settlement transaction (computed inside the TEE as follows):
       - JSON: RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS)
         - `canonical_settlement_tx_bytes` MUST be the UTF-8 encoding (no BOM) of the JCS output string.
       - XML: W3C XML Canonicalization 1.1
         - `canonical_settlement_tx_bytes` MUST be the XML C14N 1.1 octet stream output (not re-encoded as text).
       - Additional requirement: rail-specific normalization MUST be envelope-agnostic: the same settlement transaction replayed in different envelopes/messages MUST yield the same `normalized_settlement_hash`, and envelope-level metadata (e.g., message identifiers, timestamps, routing fields) MUST NOT affect `normalized_settlement_hash`.
       - The canonical settlement transaction bytes (`canonical_settlement_tx_bytes`) hashed to produce `normalized_settlement_hash` MUST include at least the canonical `transaction_identifiers` defined in §2.1.1, and MUST NOT include any `envelope_identifiers`.
     - any digest/hash computed outside the TEE MUST be treated as untrusted; the TEE MUST recompute authoritative values from `raw_payload_bytes` and reject any mismatch with host-supplied claims
     - the oracle authenticity proof,
     - and the deterministic mapping to `asset_path`.

Hex encoding conventions: the lowercase hex encoding of any 32-byte SHA-256 digest in this spec (including `raw_payload_hash`, `normalized_settlement_hash`, and `trigger_id`) MUST be exactly 64 characters long (`0-9`, `a-f`), MUST include leading zeros for leading zero bytes, and implementations MUST reject any value that does not match `^[0-9a-f]{64}$` (including `0x` prefixes, uppercase hex, incorrect length, or non-hex characters).

3. **Timelock is mandatory**
   - Verified external triggers MUST initiate the standard 144-block timelock.
   - The start height MUST use the same canonical chain-height source used by the native path.

4. **Timelock scheduling is owned by proposal emission**
   - The TEE MUST attest `timelock_delay_blocks = 144`.
   - Proposal emission MUST schedule the timelock after verifying TEE attestation.
   - Execution MUST NOT accept a `start_height` or `release_height` sourced from the raw TradFi payload.

5. **Multi-sig approvals are mandatory**
   - Verified external triggers MUST enter the same multi-sig approval policy as native proposals.

6. **Yield routing invariance**
   - Downstream yield routing MUST be identical for native vs external-triggered lock events.
   - Trigger source MUST NOT change the 5/5/90 productive streaming behavior.

7. **Idempotency / replay protection**
   - `trigger_id` MUST be computed deterministically as follows:
     - Canonicalization MUST use RFC 8785 JSON Canonicalization Scheme (JCS).
     - `rail` MUST be encoded as an uppercase ASCII string with one of: `"ISO20022"`, `"PAPSS"`, `"BRICS"`.
     - Implementations MUST reject any external settlement trigger whose `rail` field is not exactly one of the allowed strings above.
     - Expanding the rail identifier set requires a spec update, and may require versioning the `trigger_id` domain separator.
     - `normalized_settlement_hash` MUST be exactly the 64-character lowercase hex SHA-256 string over `canonical_settlement_tx_bytes` computed as specified in §1.2.
     - The canonicalized value MUST be the JCS output for the JSON object `{"rail": rail, "normalized_settlement_hash": normalized_settlement_hash}` (exact key names as shown).
     - The hash input MUST be the byte concatenation `utf8("external-settlement-trigger:v1") || utf8(JCS({"rail": rail, "normalized_settlement_hash": normalized_settlement_hash}))`.
     - The hash MUST be SHA-256 over the hash input bytes.
     - `trigger_id` MUST be the lowercase hex encoding (no `0x` prefix) of the SHA-256 digest.
     - If `trigger_id` test vectors are provided, they MUST specify `{ rail, normalized_settlement_hash, trigger_id }` using the encodings above, and SHOULD also include the canonical JCS string `JCS({"rail": rail, "normalized_settlement_hash": normalized_settlement_hash})` and the intermediate 32-byte SHA-256 digest as a 64-character lowercase hex string.
   - Idempotency is enforced at the trigger granularity (one trigger per settlement transaction).
   - Proposal emission MUST be idempotent on `trigger_id`: duplicate triggers MUST NOT create additional proposals or timelocks.

## 2. Required artifacts

### 2.1 `AttestedExternalSettlementTrigger`

Minimum fields:

- `rail` (see §1.7 for canonical encoding and allowed values)
- `raw_payload_hash` (lowercase hex encoding, no `0x` prefix, of the 32-byte SHA-256 digest of `raw_payload_bytes`)
- `settlement_identifiers` (per-rail canonical set; see below)
- `normalized_settlement_hash` (see §1.2 for canonical settlement bytes and encoding)
- `trigger_id` (lowercase hex encoding, no `0x` prefix, of the 32-byte SHA-256 digest computed as specified in §1.7)
- `asset_path`
- `timelock_delay_blocks` (must equal `144`)
- `tee_attestation`
- `oracle_verification`

Prohibited fields:

- `raw_payload_bytes`
- Any full parsed external-settlement payload structure (XML/JSON) beyond the canonical `settlement_identifiers`.

#### 2.1.1 `settlement_identifiers` (per-rail canonical set)

`settlement_identifiers` MUST be a JSON object with two namespaces:

- `transaction_identifiers`: envelope-agnostic identifiers for the settlement transaction.
- `envelope_identifiers`: envelope/message-local identifiers for audit/debug only.

`transaction_identifiers` MUST be included in the normalized settlement transaction hashed to produce `normalized_settlement_hash`.

`envelope_identifiers` MUST NOT affect `normalized_settlement_hash`.

Minimum required identifier set (by rail):

`tx_index` requirements (all rails):

- `tx_index` MUST be computed over the rail-defined settlement-transaction entries (e.g., ISO20022 `pacs.008` `CdtTrfTxInf` elements) in the exact sequence they appear in the received message payload, before any internal normalization or reordering. Implementations MUST NOT reorder transactions for indexing.
- The index MUST be computed over all transaction entries present in the received message payload, including any that are later rejected or skipped.

Example: if a message contains three settlement-transaction entries `[A, B, C]` and `B` is later rejected or skipped, any triggers emitted for `A` and `C` still use `tx_index = 0` and `tx_index = 2`.

- **ISO20022 (pacs.008)**
  - `transaction_identifiers.transaction_reference` (prefer `uetr`, else `end_to_end_id`, else `instruction_id`)
  - `envelope_identifiers.tx_index`
- **PAPSS**
  - `transaction_identifiers.transaction_reference`
  - `envelope_identifiers.tx_index`
- **BRICS**
  - `transaction_identifiers.transaction_reference`
  - `envelope_identifiers.tx_index`

Canonical formatting requirements:

- `transaction_identifiers.transaction_reference` MUST be a UTF-8 string (Unicode NFC), MUST NOT contain `\n`, and MUST preserve case.
- `envelope_identifiers.tx_index` MUST be a non-negative integer.

### 2.2 `SovereignProposal` (trigger-kind)

Minimum fields:

- `proposal_kind = EXTERNAL_SETTLEMENT_TRIGGER`
- `trigger_id`
- `asset_path`
- `timelock` (start + release heights)
- `approval_policy`

Prohibited fields:

- Any “call data” / executable contract payload that is derived from the raw TradFi bytes.

## 3. Negative test cases (must exist)

1. Missing or invalid TEE attestation → proposal emission fails.
2. Valid payload but invalid oracle proof → proposal emission fails.
3. Any attempt to include `raw_payload_bytes` or a full external-settlement payload structure in `AttestedExternalSettlementTrigger` → rejected.
4. Any attempt to supply raw TradFi payload (bytes or parsed structure) to execution code → rejected.
5. Replay the same settlement transaction (same `trigger_id`) → no new proposal/timelock created.
6. Any attempt to skip multi-sig approvals → rejected.
7. Any attempt to change timelock away from 144 blocks (increase or decrease) → rejected.
