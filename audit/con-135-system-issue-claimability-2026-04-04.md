This is an audit artifact for CON-135.

Snapshot date: 2026-04-04 (UTC)

Visibility: this snapshot is stored in a public repository. To reduce accidental disclosure of internal security/release posture, details for `internal-only` issues are intentionally redacted (identifiers are retained).

Scope: open CON system issues, operationally defined as issues in states Triage/Todo/In Progress/In Review/Backlog that have at least one of these labels: `Release`, `Governance`, `Security`, `Hygiene`, `Bounty`.

Query (as of snapshot): union of `ch-linear issue list -T CON -l <LABEL> -s Triage -s Todo -s "In Progress" -s "In Review" -s Backlog --json` for each label in [`Release`, `Governance`, `Security`, `Hygiene`, `Bounty`], de-duplicated by `identifier` (use pagination / a sufficiently high limit so results are not truncated).

## Operating definitions

- **Claim-open now (mechanical)**: `state == Todo` AND unassigned AND labels include `Bounty` and `Bounty Open`.
- **Eligible for claim-open promotion (safety)**: classified as `community-claimable` in this audit (i.e., safe for maintainers to apply the `Bounty` and `Bounty Open` labels when the other `Claim-open now (mechanical)` conditions are met).
- **Community-claimable**: safe to execute externally (docs/repo hygiene), with no privileged deploy/wallet/treasury access required. For governance/content work, this only applies when the issue has concrete acceptance criteria and maintainers retain final approval.
- **Internal-only**: security-sensitive, deployment-sensitive, wallet/treasury/signer, or release-gating work.
- **Blocked**: intended work, but can't proceed until a prerequisite is resolved.
- **Not suitable for bounty execution**: decision-heavy, underspecified, or otherwise not a good fit for external bounty execution as-is.

> Note: `community-claimable` is an audit-only safety classification (not a native Linear field). It does not by itself make an issue claim-open; claim-open status is controlled mechanically via state and labels as defined in `Claim-open now (mechanical)`. Other `community-claimable` issues remain maintainer-gated until maintainers apply `Bounty` and `Bounty Open`.

## Payout alignment

- Claim intake and maintainer review can proceed before payout readiness exists.
- **Payout-enabled bounty execution begins only after**:
  - ConxianCSF full system deployment is verified on Stacks mainnet
  - ALEX launch funding path is live and confirmed as the bounty source
  - signer, wallet, and approval controls are verified internally
  - post-deploy verification and rollback expectations are documented
- All bounty funds must be sourced exclusively from the ALEX launch pathway once deployment is live; do not use ad hoc or implied treasury commitments before that point.
- **A claim is not a payout commitment** until all of the above are satisfied and the ALEX-funded payout path is verified end-to-end with internal signer/wallet/approval controls.
- Until those checks are complete, issues may be claim-screened and worked only under explicit maintainer approval and without any implied payout commitment.

## Summary

- Total issues in scope: **90**
- Community-claimable: **14**
- Internal-only: **55**
- Blocked: **1**
- Not suitable for bounty execution: **20**
- Claim-open now (mechanical subset): **8**
