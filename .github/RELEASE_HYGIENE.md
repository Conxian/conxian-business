# Release and merge hygiene

This repository uses GitHub Actions workflows in `.github/workflows/` as the source of truth for what CI *can* run. The repository’s branch protection rules define which checks are *required* to merge to `main`.

The goals:

- Keep `main` always mergeable and safe to deploy.
- Ensure every merge has clear provenance (Linear issue + PR).
- Make releases and changelogs easy to audit.

## Required checks guidance

### Always-on checks for PRs targeting `dev`, `staged`, or `main`

These workflows run on every pull request targeting `dev`, `staged`, or `main`. Branch protection rules determine which checks are *required* to merge into protected branches (typically `staged`/`main`), and promotion PRs are expected to have all checks green before merge.

*Note:* check names shown in the PR UI may drift over time; rely on the PR UI’s required checks list when in doubt.

- Unified CI (see [`conxian-unified-ci.yml`](./workflows/conxian-unified-ci.yml))
  - Repo hygiene:
    - ZSE knowledge retention via `scripts/verify_knowledge_retention.py`.
    - Tracked artifact scanning via `scripts/verify_tracked_artifacts.py`.
      - False positives can be allowlisted via `.github/artifact-scan-allowlist.txt` (case-sensitive; paths are normalized to forward slashes with no leading `./`):
        - Patterns containing `/` are matched against the full normalized path; plain (non-glob) patterns can also match directory prefixes.
        - Patterns without `/`:
          - Plain strings (no glob wildcards: `*`, `?`, `[]`) match basenames, exact normalized paths, and directory prefixes.
          - Glob patterns match basenames and also the full normalized path for compatibility, so keep patterns as specific as possible.
        - Examples:
          - `junit.xml` matches any tracked file with basename `junit.xml` anywhere in the repo.
          - `audit/reports` matches any tracked file under `audit/reports/` (directory-prefix match).
          - `*.log` matches any tracked `.log` file by basename, and also any full path ending in `.log` (compatibility), so use with care.
    - Submodule integrity via `scripts/verify_submodule_integrity.py`.
- Secret scan (see [`secret-scan.yml`](./workflows/secret-scan.yml))
- Dependency review (see [`dependency-review.yml`](./workflows/dependency-review.yml))

### Label-gated suites (opt-in, based on change scope)

Some suites only run when a label is applied. Most label-gated suites live in the Unified CI workflow (see [`conxian-unified-ci.yml`](./workflows/conxian-unified-ci.yml)). Apply the label early so CI starts immediately.

| When you touch… | Add label | Expected CI suite |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `conxian-gateway/` or infra deployment concerns | `infra` | Gateway suite |
| `conxian-nexus/` or `lib-conclave-sdk/` | `b2b` | B2B suite (Nexus & SDK) |
| `conxius-wallet/` | `b2c` | B2C wallet suite |
| transparency audit or documentation validation | `audit` | Transparency audit + docs |
| StacksOrbit testnet simulation scripts | `simulation` | Testnet simulation |

Notes:

- The label-gated jobs only run for PRs opened from branches in this repository (not forks).
- For PRs opened from forks, a maintainer is responsible for ensuring the relevant suites run before merge.
- `showcase-dapp/` PRs can also trigger the Showcase DApp preview deployment workflow when `infra` is applied (see [`showcase-dapp-deploy.yml`](./workflows/showcase-dapp-deploy.yml)).

## PR and merge expectations

- No direct commits to `main`. Use a PR.
- One PR = one focused change (keep it reviewable).
- PRs should map to a Linear issue (include it in the PR description).
- Follow `CODEOWNERS` for review routing.
- Before merge:
  - Required checks are green.
  - Appropriate label-gated suites ran (when relevant).
  - Changelog is updated when user-facing behavior or security posture changes.

Merge preference:

- Prefer squash-merge so `main` stays readable and the merge commit message captures the PR intent.
