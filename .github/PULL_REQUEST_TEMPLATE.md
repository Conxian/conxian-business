### Feature -> dev promotion checklist

- [ ] I targeted `dev` (not `staged`/`main`) and the change is appropriate for testnet/non-production validation.
- [ ] I ran the relevant local validation for the touched areas.
- [ ] The PR is scoped and does not mix unrelated changes (especially across `.github/`, `openspec/`, `docs/`, `scripts/`).
- [ ] If this change touches wallets/signers/treasury/deployment surfaces, I described the change boundary and the expected runtime lane (`dev`/testnet).
