# Governance

This repository is governed by the Conxian Sovereign Autonomous Business (SAB).

This repository is private (as of April 8, 2026), but is treated as public for boundary purposes under Zero Secret Egress (ZSE). Governance rules must be documented without leaking privileged operational details.

Canonical business-purpose and public/private split guidance for this repo lives in `docs/BOS_BUSINESS_BUILDOUT.md`.

Canonical parent-control alignment guidance for this repo (scope boundaries, control-domain mapping, evidence, rollback, and accountability) lives in `docs/CONXIAN_BUSINESS_PARENT_CONTROL_ALIGNMENT.md`.

## Ownership

- **Repo owners:** defined by `CODEOWNERS`.
- **Policy owners:** `CODEOWNERS` is authoritative for governance, security, and documentation-policy changes.

## Branching and Promotion

All repositories in the Conxian portfolio must adhere to the [**Branching and Promotion Policy**](./docs/BRANCHING_AND_PROMOTION_POLICY.md).

- **`main` branch**: GitHub default and production branch.
- **`dev` branch**: Non-production integration branch; never the GitHub default.
- **`staged` branch**: Candidate branch between integration and production.

Ordinary work should validate locally first, then land in `dev` via pull
request. Only the exact direct and generated routes in
[`docs/BRANCH_AND_PROMOTION_STANDARD.md`](./docs/BRANCH_AND_PROMOTION_STANDARD.md)
may promote into `staged` or `main`.

## Approval model

All changes land via pull request and must follow the workflow defined in `docs/BOS_BUSINESS_BUILDOUT.md` (Linear issue linkage, `CODEOWNERS` review, and documentation-alignment/`CHANGELOG.md` update rules for boundary or policy changes).

## Documentation confidentiality (ZSE)

- Public-safe documentation may live in Git.
- Strategic, legal, operational, and administrative documents that are internal-only must be stored in the authorized Linear workspace (Kwil/Tableland) and referenced from Git with a pointer.

## Policies
