# Conxian: Sovereign Business Operations System (BOS v1.9.4)

[![Conxian Unified CI](https://github.com/Conxian/conxian-business/actions/workflows/conxian-unified-ci.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Conxian/conxian-business/actions/workflows/conxian-unified-ci.yml)
[![Deploy Documentation](https://github.com/Conxian/conxian-business/actions/workflows/deploy-docs.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Conxian/conxian-business/actions/workflows/deploy-docs.yml)

This repository is the GitHub-first, public-safe **Business Operations System (BOS) workspace** for Conxian governance, portfolio coordination, specifications, delivery traceability, and evidence.

GitHub is canonical only for public-safe work. Private repository visibility does not authorize restricted data: do not store restricted legal, financial, security, identity, custody, recovery, strategy, or privileged operational records in GitHub. See the [GitHub-First BOS Operating Model](./docs/GITHUB_FIRST_BOS_OPERATING_MODEL.md).

Supporting — Governance + OpenSpec + submodule wiring for the Conxian ecosystem.

See the [repo portfolio](docs/REPO_PORTFOLIO.md#ecosystem-repos) for the flagship/supporting repo map and `docs/BOS_BUSINESS_BUILDOUT.md` for the business-end operating model and public/internal split.

## Canonical documentation

- [`docs/PORTFOLIO_BUSINESS_UNIT_MAP.md`](./docs/PORTFOLIO_BUSINESS_UNIT_MAP.md)
- [`docs/DOCUMENTATION_ALIGNMENT_INDEX.md`](./docs/DOCUMENTATION_ALIGNMENT_INDEX.md)

## Purpose

Define and version Conxian's Business Operations System (BOS) as an auditable, programmatic state machine (OpenSpec, governance, and operational artifacts).

## Status

Active. This repository is private (as of April 8, 2026), but remains public-safe by policy and is the canonical GitHub workspace for BOS-level specifications and portfolio coordination.

This status framing is being kept aligned during the `conxius-platform` documentation transition.

Documentation here follows public-safe boundary rules; restricted records remain in an approved non-Git restricted-record system under ZSE.

Release and SemVer tagging follows the process in `RELEASING.md` (`vX.Y.Z`), with history tracked in `CHANGELOG.md`.

## Audience

- Contributors implementing Conxian's protocol, infrastructure, and tools.
- Partners and auditors who need a canonical, versioned view of OpenSpec.

## Relation to Conxian stack

The Conxian ecosystem is organized by function to ensure clarity and modularity across the Sovereign Autonomous Business (SAB) stack. See the **[BOS Runtime Ownership Map](./conxian-business/BOS_RUNTIME_OWNERSHIP_MAP.md)** for detailed responsibility boundaries.

- **[`conxian-business/`](./conxian-business)**: **BOS Operations**. Commercial, legal, and platform specifications (ZSE Stubs).
- **[`conxius-platform/`](./conxius-platform)**: **Orchestration**. Stack orchestration and local development.
- **[`conxius-orbit/`](./conxius-orbit)**: **Ops Tooling**. Deployment and operations automation.

### 2. Core Operating Suite (EXCO Agents)
- **[`conxian-nexus/`](./conxian-nexus)**: **State Node**. High-level orchestration, state roots (MMR), and decentralized storage.
- **[`conxian-gateway/`](./conxian-gateway)**: **Middleware**. x402 mandates, RPC pooling, and ZKML compliance.

## Quick start / Next action

This repository uses Git submodules.

```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Conxian/conxian-business
cd conxian-business
```

`conxius-platform/` is configured with `update = none`, so it will be skipped by default during recursive submodule updates. To opt in:

```bash
git -c submodule.conxius-platform.update=checkout submodule update --init conxius-platform
```

If you need the `conxius-platform/` nested submodules, initialize them from within that repo (for example):

```bash
cd conxius-platform
git submodule update --init services/conxian-ui
```

Next action after clone: review `docs/REPO_PORTFOLIO.md` for ecosystem context and `docs/BOS_BUSINESS_BUILDOUT.md` for public/internal boundary rules.

## Ownership

Ownership and review requirements are defined in [`CODEOWNERS`](./CODEOWNERS). `CODEOWNERS`-designated policy owners are authoritative for governance, security, and documentation-policy changes.

## Security / Governance

For general support and non-security bug reports, open a GitHub issue. For security vulnerabilities, follow the private reporting process in [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md).

This repository follows Zero Secret Egress (ZSE) boundary discipline. See [Repository visibility and public/private boundary](#repository-visibility-and-publicprivate-boundary).

## Repository visibility and public/private boundary

Treat this repository as private in hosting visibility, but public-safe for boundary purposes. Detailed strategy, legal interpretations, operational runbooks, infrastructure identifiers, and any secret inventory remain in an approved non-Git restricted-record system, in compliance with our Zero Secret Egress (ZSE) mandate.

Detailed strategy and roadmap content must not be duplicated in this README; see `docs/BOS_BUSINESS_BUILDOUT.md` for the public vs internal documentation rules.

Some files are intentionally kept as stubs so existing links continue to resolve.

## BOS Architecture and Wallet Control

The Conxian Business Operations System (BOS) follows a strict **SAB-owned wallet architecture** to ensure system-controlled automation and auditable financial flows.

- **Wallet Architecture**: See [`docs/SAB_WALLET_ARCHITECTURE_AND_CONTROL_MATRIX.md`](./docs/SAB_WALLET_ARCHITECTURE_AND_CONTROL_MATRIX.md).
- **Handoff Protocol**: The staged migration from personal bootstrap control to SAB and DAO governance is defined in [`docs/SAB_DAO_HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md`](./docs/SAB_DAO_HANDOFF_PROTOCOL.md).
- **Controlled Operational Mappings**: Detailed wallet remapping and signer mapping records are maintained in private governance/operations systems; public stubs are retained only for link continuity.

## Ground truth (OpenSpec)

The definitive technical specifications for the Conxian ecosystem are maintained in the `openspec/` directory. See the [Enterprise Sovereignty Baseline](./openspec/changes/remediate-enterprise-sovereignty/specs.md) for the latest architectural standards.

## Governance and security

We adhere to strict sovereignty and security standards.

For general support and non-security bug reports, open a GitHub issue. For security vulnerabilities, follow the private reporting process in `SECURITY.md`.

## Repository catalog

See [`docs/REPOSITORY_CATALOG.md`](./docs/REPOSITORY_CATALOG.md) for the org-level submodule catalog and pinning guidance.

## Repository hygiene

To maintain a clean and sovereign workspace, we adhere to strict hygiene standards:

- **`scripts/`**: Contains active utility scripts (e.g., `check_links.py`).
- **`ARCHIVE_MIGRATION.md`**: ZSE-safe pointers to legacy material intentionally kept out of the Git index.
- **`openspec/`**: Definitive technical specifications.
- **Artifact Hygiene**: Scratch scripts and temporary fix-up files (e.g., `*_fix.py`) are excluded from the repository to maintain a clean production environment.
